And for the first time in my adult life, I was on the losing side Nov 8th. I was never excited about Hillary, but I believed a deeply flawed man like Donald Trump was even worse. I have given much thought since Tuesday to what common ground I have with the Donald and his supporters. I realize that I share many if not most of your views. \n\nI believe in restructuring of unfair trade deals. I believe the super wealthy must be made to pay their fair share. I believe Islamic extremism and the hateful culture it cultivates is the greatest threat to humanity currently on planet Earth. I believe the liberal elite have lost touch with the essential American experience. The deal-breakers for me were anti-gay Pence and the insensitivity to minorities the Trump campaign seemed to show. \n\n\nThis image brought home to me just how our brothers and sisters in France have suffered as a consequence of the liberal globalist policies I have so often espoused. I still believe in fairness and equal treatment, but is it fair to give up our freedom to accommodate people who never paid the price for it? I am still thinking through all the details, but provided Donald is in earnest about fair and equal treatment under the law for gays and minorities, count me among the converts.\n\n Vive la france, vive la libert\u00e9."}], "Alfapike": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "awesome work.  \n\nIt does stir emotions."}], "VermillionHydra": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Beautiful let's fucking do this centipedes!"}]}, "selftext": "", "suggested_sort": null}
