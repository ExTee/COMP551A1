It's technically urban hiking, but [it doesn't look all that urban in the stretch behind my back yard](http://imgur.com/SO8nM); however, [some of the stairs are ... different](http://i.imgur.com/obf9NVw.jpg).\n\nOr ...  you can go north 30 minutes to [Parc de la Jacques Cartier](http://www.sepaq.com/pq/jac/), where you may kayak in [the Jacques Cartier river](http://imgur.com/dSwHkui) (mind the \"U-shaped\" glacial valley in the back). I understand rentals are possible, or you may bring your own. There is also no shortage of hiking trails.\n\nIf you have more than 1 or 2 days, about an hour east of QC is the [Parc des Grands Jardins](http://www.sepaq.com/pq/grj/) which I highly recommend for it's hiking ([and views](http://imgur.com/Iv87011)).
