I was more going off of /backbone89's comment that 'it looks like propaganda'\n\nThis is what I wonder:\n\nI have no location for this picture. There are about 5-6 people I can see in the picture. They are all posing for the camera to look like they are a large group. Also, they are all dressed in black, a symbol of the women in Sharia law. The women wearing a hijab in black is now associated as a symbol that makes people angry. No male supporters there too? Why? The picture is low resolution. Why?\n\nI am more worried about people being riled up to fight a war and harm people for something that they were lied to about. Are there people murdering people in your neighborhood? According to the news, yes and it is getting much worse!  Are there people immigrating and networking with the french society? Most certainly, but I doubt that makes much news. Are there people who support this? Yes, but how many? If 1000 people did over all of France, they would be seeked out for news because this is topical. Are there people against it? Yes, but according to the news, they are unable to get support and are being ignored.\n\nI worry about people being misled. I worry that this photo is doctored to make you angry and attack a group who, for the majority, are nice and good people. Not all people in France are nice, but most are. Some are jerks.
