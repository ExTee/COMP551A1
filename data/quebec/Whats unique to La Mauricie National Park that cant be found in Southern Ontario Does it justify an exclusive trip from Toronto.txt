Around 30 minutes/1 hour drive from your camping spot if you are on the east side of the park.\n\nBut yeah, it not worth a 6 hour trip from Ontario ONLY for that. A lot of tourist from Europe and Asia goes there, but it's something completly different for them. A brand new experience. Maybe for someone from Ontario, you wont appreciate the park as much.\n\nBut if you really love camping and wanna visit La Mauricie National Park as a side trip to a Montreal trip, this may worth the time and effort. But if you do, you have to spend at least 4-5 days in the park imo.\n\nOr you could just visit Shawinigan and go to the park as a side trip. I mean, Shawinigan is pretty dope imo.\n"}], "fire_i": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "If your grandparents are big park buffs or are tired of visiting the Ontarian parks, they might enjoy seeing a similar, but different place.
