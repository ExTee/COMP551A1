I had a course on cultural differences at my English class, back when I was a student. The teacher was American. So, obviously, the cultural differences we talked about were mostly American vs French. \n\nIn a nutshell, as you say, Americans may smile a lot at you and can be very easy to approach and talk to. I even heard that in the USA, you can easily bump into a group of people stranger to you, and they can invite you to their next barbecue party. But that's how far it will go. You are unlikely to be friend with this/these person(s), and see him/her/them over and over again.\n\nNow, in France, it tends to be quite the opposite. It takes meeting someone several times over before being considered as a friend. The first contact with the French can be cold. French (and probably many other Europeans) will be vaguely aloof to strangers indeed. Hence why, as a stranger, it's easy to make a false judgment and think the French are antipathetic. But this friend you would make would be someone who would stick around and be someone you can call to meet up and have fun with or dine out with on a regular basis. And this friend would be someone you can share personal matters with.\n\nOf course, this is a generalization. Not every single American falls into the description I made I assume, and not every single French falls into the description I made above neither.\n\nI am not saying the French way or the American way is better/worse. I guess it just boils down to cultural differences."}]}, "Body": "Sorry it took so long to get back to you.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, Americans just feel the need to be all bright and cheery 24/7. You can easily see this if you're walking down any street when random strangers will smile and nod at you. This may seem nice, but very few people are actually sincere in this. I find the whole thing sickly sweet. \n\nNow I've heard that many Europeans (the French included), are more \"aloof\" to strangers, for lack of a better word.

It has been claimed to depict the decadence of the French aristocracy shortly before the French Revolution, thereby exposing the perversions of the so-called Ancien R\u00e9gime.
