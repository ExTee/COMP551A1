Now that's my choice but it has its perks. \nThere is a strong community from Cabo Verde, hence Portuguese products, restaurants and shops. \nThere is also a dedicated, confortable bus with WiFi and all to commute daily to Sophia which is a very good option compared to anything but sleeping in your office. \nNow for the prices, Nice offer a broad range of options. For a couple with baby a nice three rooms apartment can do and be rented from 8/900 and up. Life in general is expensive compared to other French areas, Paris excluded. But the range of options in Nice would make it easier. Cutting on costs, like daily commutes and car ownership would definitely help.

I don't know if you are Portuguese but if yes and if you want you child to have some chance to be in Portuguese classes your only chance is Nice.\nIn any case you will need a rather good salary to have a good flat and feed your family (in case your wife stays at home).\nAs a matter of personal taste and convenience i would recommend staying in Antibes. There is a reasonably good Portuguese shop in Golfe Juan that doubles as a proper churrasqueira on week-ends.\nGood luck with this opportunity."}], "roctruith": [{"Replies": {"Compalvital": [{"Replies": {"roctruith": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "I meant by car: it's atrocious.\nPublic transportation are also complicated within Sophia Antipolis, but entirely doable!\n\nThe quality of life is super nice! Most villages in that area are quiet, clean, and you always find a good place to go out. And it is not so much rural, you will rarely be more than 30minutes from the seaside.\nAnd if you wanna go have dinner, and you are used to eat late at night (you probably are since you're living in Lisbon), you won't have any problems at all going to Cannes, Golfe-Juan or even Antibes! If you own a car, you'll be down there in less than 20min where there is no traffic.\n\nAs for the prices, not gonna lie, for 1k\u20ac you can probably find a 2bd flat, but you won't have much space, think between 50 and 70m\u00b2.\nHonestly, you can find all kind of prices, and you have to be very thorough in your research because a lot of real estate agencies tend to inflate the prices because they know demand is high over there."}]}, "Body": "Thanks. When you think of commute, do you mean by public transportation or by car?\n\nHow's the quality of life in those rural areas? I'm used to both the city and countryside way of living, so I'm ok moving to a smaller village. The only thing I care is about having options, the more the better. Let's say I want to go out for dinner, I don't want to be limited to an handful of options. Is that the case with those smaller villages?\n\nDo you think I can find a nice 2 bedrooms apartment for 1000\u20ac or less in Antibes?"}]}, "Body": "I think you should look for near villages instead of coastal cities.\nLook for Biot, Mougins (expensive), Valbonne, Roquefort-les-pins, Mouans-Sartoux, or even Vallauris.\n\nI lived in Vallauris for 3 years, and the time travel from there to Sophia was ~30 minutes, so not that bad.\n\nAs for salary, if you are the only source of income, I would say... 2000\u20ac/month will be a minimum, but it usually pays better in this area.\n\nLike others said, avoid AT ALL COST Cannes, or anything between Antibes and Nice. The commute will be HELL, and the prices too high. Aim for the quiter country side!"}], "Gastibelza": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Take a look at Vence, La Gaude and Saint Jeannet.
