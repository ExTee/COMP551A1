Meme Magic was extremly effective in america because of the presence of internet deeply installed in the american society. Here it's not as effective, the stats of the french population is different too : Here you have a majority of baby boomers who harvested the fruits of their previous generation and kept them for themselves as well as gurgling their ideals of open borders and all that shit. Since they are thriving since almost 50 years they had all their time to put stigma on Marine via the Le Pen name (Donald Trump wasnt as much politically involved back then compared to Marine Le Pen) It's a battle where we dont have the edge at all and i fear that the weight of those old farts of 68tards could still prevent her from getting into office. However, judging by the Trump like crowds she's drawing in her public reunions she has her chance. Because it's one of the craziest presidential race in France's history it's hard to know what to do now, Marine is \"working the meat\" more and more by hitting the subjects like immigration but it's up to her. Merluche is just pushed by the medias to trigger cuckservatives voters and 68tards, Macron has deflated and Hamon is just here to burry the socialist party"}], "sonofbaal_tbc": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "make memes , post memes "}]}, "selftext": "Are we winning?
