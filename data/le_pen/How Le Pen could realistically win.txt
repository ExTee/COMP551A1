I know the vast majority of people aren't. A small minority at the top of government have wasted our tax money on funding terrorist militant groups. I'm certaintly opposed to that. But then again, who are these terrorists? Who is fighting within their ranks? Muslims of course, and don't forget the primary funders of Islamic terrorism, even more so than the West, are Middle Eastern nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Turkey and a few other Gulf Nations.\n\n>>Islamic terrorist are just the symptom of the corrupted and colonialist politics we have run over the years.\n\nAbsolute nonsense. Colonialism helped the countries more than they damaged them. What frustrates me most is that millions of French colonists were expelled from Algeria by the Algerian nationalists, yet millions of Algerians are free to come to France and live there without issue. The only issues of course being the ones they create.\n\n>>You don't cure the disease by treating the symptoms but by targeting the source of the problem.\n\nI am targetting the problem you fool! XD The problem is the massive presence of Muslims in the West who are highly suspectible to terrorism and do not sympathise with the countries they live in. The solution is to physically remove terrorists, terrorist sympathisers and those who want the implentation of Sharia law in western countries. This would result in the remaining Muslim population being composed of moderates and liberals, with less conservatives and extremist Muslims present to radicalise them."}]}, "Body": "> Not an issue, stop importing Islamists and deport all Islamist-leaning individuals.\n\nWell first of all, Le Pen has never said anything about deporting anyone.

France is France and should remain French. If closing the border results in more terrorist attacks, those people were already anti-western Islamists, and now they have an excuse to attack. Deport them. Why should natives pander to the feelings of foreigners? They are in our countries, why should be base policy on making them feel nice and not offended? Does Saudi Arabia drop its policy on imprisoning Christians who publicy preach the bible in order to please the West? No. No Muslim country will change it's laws to pander to the West, yet Muslims expect the West to pander to them and allow them to enter in uncontrolled numbers whilst they carry out attacks and shout islamophobia, all the while they contribute less to the economy than the native population, drain more welfare and have much higher birthrates resulting in them rapidly growing in percentage of the population and having more influence over the politics of a nation they are not part of - not because I say they're not part of, but because they themselves (for the most part) don't identify as French."}]}, "Body": "I disagree, we are a very unproductive country.

The only group that was protesting against gay mariage in France where big time christians (which a lot of them are pro-Le Pen), not muslims. Besides, Le Pen is herself against gay rights, she wants for instance to prevent homosexuals from using assisted procreation. If anything, Le Penistes are the ones who should open themselves up to diversity and gay rights.\n\nIf Le Pen wins, sure there's going to be solidarity towards our muslims neighbours but good thoughts aren't going to change her actions that are going to stigmatise and hurt them. \n\nShe's going to make it harder for them to integrate by removing double-nationality rights and abolishing the right of the soil, taxing companies who are employing immigrants wether they are well integrated or not. She's going to prevent immigrants from rejoining their family which is going to isolate them more, she's going to remove the state medical help which is going to make more muslims ill, etc. the list goes on and on.\n\nI'm all for enforcing border security, which is what Macron is gonna do anyways but Le Pen politics as a whole is going to help ISIS by validating their narrative and making it harder for muslims to integrate with all these regulations.

This party started as a openly antisemitic and ultra-liberalist with Jean-Marie Le Pen. When her daughter came, she was smarter than him so she fired him and she switch the xenophobia from jews to muslims because jews have more power here and it's easier to go after muslims. She also softened the liberalist narrative without much changes to her economic program which is clearly pro-companies and not social or anything. \nMarine Le Pen started the party with literal Nazis (Fr\u00e9deric Chatillon among others) and always surround herself with Skinheads in suits. She employed crooked accountants and have been stealing dozens of millions of \u20ac from the state with the scam knows as the Jeanne/Riwal \"campaign kit\" scheme. Her party has now a ton of off shore accounts in Honk Kong, Pananma, etc. and is run and managed like a company and ruled by it's economics, not by its politics.\n\nHer politics is not only going to enforce ISIS but also going to fuck over everyone economically.

It will cost Billions to build which could be better spent elsewhere, millions to maintain, and years to build. Trump has said Mexico will pay for it but they have said they won't repeatedly to the point where Trump had tried to get funding through Congress today but had to remove it. You can not force another country to give you money just by telling them they have to. What's more a wall is only useful if it is manned otherwise people can go over it or break it and go through it. Finally legalising pot and decriminalising other drugs and treating them as a social problem will mean drug smuggling will be less of an issue and foreign aid to help other countries will make people less likely to want to reach America illegally.\n\nTerm limits are not the answer. Firstly experienced politicians are not a bad thing; people who know how things work and understand the system are good things. The reason Donald Trump is changing his mind on so many issues (NATO, NAFTA, healthcare) is because he did not know the difficulties before he was elected. The better way of fixing this would be to stop gerrymandering, reduce the amount of money in politics, make politics more transparent (eg make politicians release their financial details) introduce a right to recall, have a more educated electorate.\n\nFree college will help the poorer members of society more. Those who can't currently afford to go will get better access. Many manual jobs and those that can be easily automated will disappear in the coming years and having a more educated populace will mean they will be more able to get jobs and letting them start off life with out the burden of huge debts will make it even easier. A more educated populace is good for everyone else too (think of it a bit like everyone having access to healthcare).\n\nI am socially liberal but don think \"racism against blacks still exists, and racism against whites can never exist\" and various other things you mention; you are attacking the whole of the left by focusing on the extremes (the same sort of thing Trump supporters get angry about when people bring up the KKK and the like.\n\nJumping from Bernie to Trump just because you don't like Clinton and \"politics as usual\" is not the way to go about it. You can still be against politics as usual with out jumping on the_donald band wagon."}]}, "Body": "It's a mix. It depends on the topic. \n\nI didn't understand why capitalism was good until I listened to Trump talk. After that, I know now why limiting taxes and restrictions on business is important. I still want America to legalize pot. I still think America should adopt a healthcare system like Canada or the UK, single-payer. I've seen enough radical islamic terror since then that I don't want refugees anymore (Germany woke me up in 2014/2015). I still think America needs a huge legal system reform (I know pot dealers who got more jail time than pedos, need to fix that). I started off not knowing what to think about the wall, but T_D showed me facts about it, and now I want the wall. I've always wanted congress to have term limits and big money influence on politics to end. Drain the swamp is why I voted Bernie, and why I voted Trump. I just didn't know that Bernie would sell out, and I didn't fully realize how stupid $15 minimum wage and free college were. (In terms of Macron, I think refugees are his weak spot, hit that hard). \n\nOn social issues, I used to play along and accept SJWs. I'm in uni, so their culture is everywhere. They said white males are always the oppressors in history. They said there's a pay gap between men and women. They said racism against blacks still exists, and racism against whites can never exist. They said minorities need special treatment and special scholarships for college. They said there are 9163849202847383 genders, and if anyone didn't believe them, they made that person into an un-human in everyone's mind. Easier to be cruel to an un-human, and nobody would ever want to help a racist, sexist, homophobic, whatever. Doxxing, whatever it took. I always thought the lengths they went to were harsh, and I always thought they were a little too harsh on modern white males who had nothing to do with slavery, but I didn't speak up too loudly about it. Then Trump came and all you wonderful people used plain facts to show how the SJWs were wrong on Every. Single. Thing. It really feels like I've woken up. \n\nI still believe gay marriage is okay. If someone wants to change genders, cool, just wait to switch bathrooms until after the operation. \n\nOther than that, the pay gap exists because a lot of women major in gender studies instead of something that will give them a high-paying job. Giving special scholarships to minorities is rewarding them for not working hard keeping them down, and it is a racist idea because it assumes the minorities are less qualified. Whites are socially oppressed in America and there's currently a white genocide happening in South Africa. And SJWs don't care about any of that because it goes against the narrative, which they carefully constructed because they want free stuff and special treatment. "}]}, "Body": "Did you do a 180 on Bernie's philosophy? As in switch to a Friedman/Smith-esque libertarian/capitalistic viewpoint? I'm just curious, I assume many Bernie voters went to Trump just because of the horrifying alternative, rather than actually converting to his approach to many political/social issues. \n\nI only ask because I wonder if jumping ship is circumstantial  and temporary, or whether you can genuinely convert opinion when pushed into compromise. This slippery bastard Macron will avoid this like Hillary did, because 1) He's \"centrist\" (don't make me laugh, he used to be chair in the socialist party), so is ostensibly more \"accomodating\" to moderate voters;  2) He hasn't done (or rather, been caught) in anything scandalous or corrupt.

What happened in France is that initially a mjaority of under 25s were going to vote Le Pen but then Melenchon did well in the TV debates and swung them over to him. Now that he's out I'm guessing a large chunk of these young voters will return to Le Pen as a result of her and Melenchon's similar views on economics and the EU. The only question is whether or not the far left will be able to give up on their objections to her foreign policy, social conservatism and anti-immigrant stance in exchange for preventing a pro-EU neoliberal globalist from taking power.
