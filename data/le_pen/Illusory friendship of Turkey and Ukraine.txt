On the one hand, we may witness the advancement of the bilateral relations towards closer dialog. In wake of the recent series of meetings between Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, his Turkish counterpart Binali Yildirim and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the parties involved have managed to agree on the enhancement of bilateral trade volumes and aviation traffic, expanding cooperation in military-technical and energy spheres.

The Turkish side has sustained huge losses in the aftermath of its debacle with Russia: ban on the activities of the Turkish businessmen, embargo on entry of goods and restrictions for Russian tourists coming to Turkey have had a visible negative impact on Turkish economy.

Ankara&#39;s worry is that this structure could come under umbrella of FET\u00d6, the organization led by Fethullah  Gulen, the spiritual leader of the Turkish opposition accused by Ankara of plotting the coup in Turkey in 2016. Turkish secret services have every reason to believe that dissatisfied militant elements among Crimean Tatars may well join the ranks of FET\u00d6. As far back as a year ago the Turkish news media outlet Anadolu reported that FET\u00d6 had created its network and was active in Ukraine. Furthermore, Poroshenko&#39;s agents have been intensely seeking contact with the FET\u00d6 emissaries.
