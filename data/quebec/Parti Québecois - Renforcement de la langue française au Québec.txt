Do I speak it well? Fuck no. I work in English, go home to an English household, and have a social life in English. It's a use it or lose it situation. I suspect I'll be able to read and comprehend most of it as long as I'm living here, but I sure as hell will never be fluent speaking it. That's what happens when the province doesn't force its use. \n\nHaha I don't think you hit a nerve as much as you think. I sympathize with your plight and I respect your culture. I'm right with society in my eyes, so none of this bothers me. The courses have been taken and I legitimately try to have conversations in French when the moments present themselves. I'm perfectly content with the effort I put into it. Fact is, nothing more is required of me. I am in no obligation to live my life in French when English pays my bills and takes care of my family. Quebec wanted me to pass a test. Then they wanted my ass to return to work in English. THAT is Quebec's reality in 2017. "}]}, "Body": "Feh. You don't even speak french yourself.\n\nAnyways, I'm glad I've hit a nerve; you show you're not open to Qu\u00e9bec's reality."}]}, "Body": "Sucking big time to Anglos? You mean all of the English doctors, dentists, etc. coming out of the woodwork to cater to them? Or are you talking about how easy it is to immigrate here without a damn bit of French needed? In the last 6 years of living in Quebec, it's easier for me to get around and speak less French than ever before. \n\nPeople are literally entering the province without any knowledge of French, learning how to do a trade in English, and then working in English. All in this French province here. Why are you acting as if this is OUR problem? We're not your enemy haha. By all means, go correct it. But as long as you're relying on the English language in any way within Quebec, you're basically putting out a massive welcome mat. So of course if you make money off of the language, you have to cater to it. It shouldn't be some massive surprise. If your efforts are to remove the influence of the outside world, you have my support. I'm here for the industry I'm in. The companies are here because of the government. The catering to the English language exists because there's a need for it. See how this goes full circle? You want one, you get the other, naturally. You can't have just one.\n\n>If you respect our History, do not shit on our efforts to correct the bad things that came out of it.\n\nNo problem, as long as you don't make my life a living hell. Fight the source of the problem, not me. Trying to make it harder for Anglos to live here won't solve this. That's just pissing people off on both sides. Remove the reliance on the English language and you remove the reason to even be here in the first place. This, I can wholeheartedly support. But don't go expecting immigrants to stand idly by while you try to pass laws to make existing here a pain in the dick. Again, source of the issue. Attack that.\n\nAnd what's your deal with the history? History is there to learn from, not hold grudges. The Anglos here aren't the Anglos from back then. They're different people. Fuck, I hate that we're two separate sides based on mother tongue. It's ridiculous. I'd like to think we'd be able to have a beer and be friends. You know as well as I do that we can't go back and change history. \n\nJust out of curiosity, what's the perfect incarnation of Quebec to you? What's the ideal situation where both sides are happy from your point of view? Would that be a Quebec without any outside influences? Like...we do away with essentially all imports? Maybe ban any other language other than French from being spoken? I'm not trying to be facetious. Just trying to get a more complete understanding of your situation and your feelings. I have plenty of Franco friends who have the complete opposite point of view from you. So hearing your thoughts would definitely help me understand a bit better."}]}, "Body": "In case you haven't noticed, the current government is sucking big time to Anglos.\n\nIf you respect our History, do not shit on our efforts to correct the bad things that came out of it."}]}, "Body": "We? Who's we? From where I'm sitting, the Quebec government sure as hell loves that sweet, sweet \"English cash.\" Tax breaks are bringing English-operated corporations here. Hell, they've tried to remove them before just to do take-backs once they realized how much money they'd lose when businesses leave. It's all about money, my friend. Makes the world go round. \n\nI respect your history. I learned a great deal when I was working on my CSQ. You are right in that I still have a ton to learn. For instance, I have no idea how it got to this point; where businesses are bringing in talent from outside to work jobs in a language that isn't considered a provincial language. I don't find pleasure in frustrating the locals. For what little consolation it probably is to you, I'm on your side. I'd rather see everyone happy. But it's not a situation that can be fixed without some serious changes on the government level from what I can tell. "}]}, "Body": "Typical ignorant Anglo response...
