What *HAVE* they done. Sorry dude, but France is France and China is China. Period. Only globalist cucks believe that we should open our boarders to immigrants. I dont even want germans here, and you think chinese should be allowed in to take all the jobs away from hard working christian frenchmen? what sub is this?\n\nI dont see white people going to china and taking there jobs sticting soccer balls. It's not all about crime. Immigrants of all kinds come and they take the good jobs away from real French people. At least the belgians and swiss have a CHANCE of assimiliating, but people from China are totally different species than French people to be honest. They speak a different language with different letters, they eat different food and bugs and shit. France is and always has been a WHITE CHRISTIAN nation. Sorry. \n\nWe dont force China to be like France. We dont force Japan to be like Italy. So why is it fair to turn America into Mexico or France into China. This messed up culture of globalist immigration and open boarders HAS TO STOP STOP STOP! \n\nTell me WHY we should open up France to people from all over the world with a diffrent culture language religion etc.!? Honestly I cant BELIEVE the downvotes I have here. We must be brigaded by PC SJW globalist cucks who want to open up immigration and ruin cultural purity. If you REALLY support diversity, you should want to protect France from becoming a half-arab half-chinese mutt. Its time to PROTECT FRENCH CULTURE.\n#MAGA #MFGA\n\n"}], "Newage117": [{"Replies": {"cyandpo": [{"Replies": {"altrightnostradamus": [{"Replies": {"Newage117": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfa9"}]}, "Body": ">I think a small amount of legal immigration is ok.\n\nWHY!? What benefit does it have to let Chinese or anyone else invade France? How does it make France great to let in Chinese? They take French jobs. They bring in a foreign culture that is 100% different. They dont speak French or write French. They dont look like French or know the history of France. They aren't Christians. And they're communists, above all else. So if you say \"immigration is OK\" tell me why? What benefit does immigration bring to the French people or anyone else? \n\nDogs should live with dogs, and chinese should live in china. Even if you say it's \"1%\", it was \"0%\" a few years ago, before you no it its 5% and then 10%. Look at places like Vancouver Canada where all the signs are in CHINESE FIRST AND ENGLISH SECOND. Enough is enough. Its basic commen sense. French dont want to go to china, and they wouldnt let them in anyway. Go somewhere else. OUT! OUT!
