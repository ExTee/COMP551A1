There are points under that charter that specify the desire for a French work environment. \n\nJust speaking from my personal experiences, so completely anecdotal. But from where I'm at in the tech industry, video games to be exact, we're looking at a near 100% English work environment in Quebec. That's not to say French isn't spoken. On the contrary, it's the mother language of many of the employees. But the way business is conducted, we break a lot of the rules. And we're allowed to. I can only assume it's money-related. The video game industry brings in over 260 million dollars in revenue in Quebec, alone. That's a lot of money made in an English work environment within a province that wishes to minimize its presence. \n\nJust to name a few laws broken: Computers operated in English. Work documentation constructed, stored, and referenced in English only. Meetings held in English only. Employees terminated for lack of English language capabilities. From my understanding, this is completely unlawful within the fundamental language rights listed in the charter. A smaller company would never get away with blatantly disregarding this. Which leads me to believe it would have more to do with the money being made. \n\nAnyway, it's an interesting topic, donc merci pour la discussion! I have a lot of respect for the French language and genuinely want to see everyone happy. Hell, if I were forced to work in French, I'd probably be fluent by now haha. \n\nEDIT: Woh, I take that 260 million/yr back. Apparently it has grown quite a bit since I last checked. Not seeing an exact number, but it looks like last year 3.3 billion was added to Canada's GDP from the gaming industry country-wide. And 70% of the largest studios are located in Quebec, so..... Yeah, quite a bit of money made here in English haha. "}]}, "Body": "There is money to be made of the English language? And how the law 101 helps to achieve this? "}]}, "Body": "Thanks for the post. That was a neat read. As an anglophone who has lived in Quebec, I still struggle to understand the law completely. It seemed to have been made with good intent. Nowadays, though, it seems more like a law of convenience, allowed to be broken in certain cases when there's money to be made off of the English language. I can't help but feel like it'll continue to be a hot topic for years to come as long as Quebec desires to compete in the world market. "}]}, "selftext": "", "suggested_sort": null}
