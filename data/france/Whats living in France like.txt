Great beaches, great skiing, music, films, fashion... It's kinda expensive in my opinion, and getting more so all the time. I live in a rural area and getting used to the opening hours was pretty strange for a while (shut for lunch, shut for Mondays, possibly also Wednesday afternoons, certainly all of August...). From a US perspective, you'd probably be pretty blown away by the number of public holidays and public services. \n\nThe language is a challenge. It's not so hard to learn the basics, and in general people will be very helpful and patient. It's even ok getting to understand specific vocabularies as and when you need them (e.g. Medical when you need a dr, technical when you need a mechanic). But having enough fluency to make friends, that's tough. It involves understanding nuances, humor and cultural references.
