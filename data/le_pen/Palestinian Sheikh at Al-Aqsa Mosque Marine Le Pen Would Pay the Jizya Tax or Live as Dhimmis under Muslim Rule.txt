While Jews might be represented in things bigger than their numbers in the population as a whole, they still aren't anywhere close to the majority in anything in Europe (or America, for that matter) aside from overtly Jewish and Judaism/Jewry related things. Being overepresented doesn't mean \"control;\" that's illogic. Same with media and banks; Jews are overrepresented (they're 2% of the population but might be 20, 30% in finance or media), but that's not a majority or a totality. You look at the boards of JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, you will not count more Jews than non-Jews. Ditto for nearly all other banks, media, etc. Sure you might find more as a percent than in the population as a whole, but that's not \"controlling anything.\"\n\nContrast to the fact that 100% of Islamic terrorists are Muslim.\n\nAlso, you do realize [BDS is extremely Pro-Palestinian & anti-Israel](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/po3RpaOUMTw/maxresdefault.jpg), supports [BDS and calls it a genocidal apartheid state, right?](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/11/black-lives-matters-movement-palestine-platform-israel-critics). They love Hamas. \n\nSoros, a former Kapo, a self-loathing ethnic Jew who neither practices Judaism nor helps it, bankrolls [anti-Israel groups](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/216382), some of who claim to be anti-Zionist or \"pro-peace\" Jews, which is not the mainstream in America, Europe (where Jews are more to the right than in America, where Jews actually vote with the population at large), and in Israel.\n\nSince you're from Europe, and your views on Jews are commonplace there, I laid out the facts of you to see."}]}, "Body": "doesn't mean all jews, but there are many of jews behind the new multicultural agenda \n\nsee all media and banking organizaitons.
