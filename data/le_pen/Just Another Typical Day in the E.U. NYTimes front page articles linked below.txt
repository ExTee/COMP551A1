Those who travel to Syria aren't from our middle or upper class. They are from the lower classes -again- with no real perspective or future here. \nAnd you are right. Islam as it currently is, is shifted to the right into extremism. However you have to look at the reasons for this. Shia Islam became more extreme when the US overthrew the Iranian leader and the only place where militans were safe from prosecution were mosques and so the revolution which brought the current government into power resulted from a mix of militarism and religion.\nSunni Islam is quite similar in that respect. They were radicalised when the US and the SU fought over the Middle East in the Cold War (Mostly Afghanistan). Both became a tool for nationalistic militias. \nBut the religion in general is no worse than Christianity. (Again: I don't like religions in general. You see this as me saying Islam is not that bad after all. What I mean is that all religions are equally f*cked up.)"}]}, "Body": "This comment really shows how little you actually know about Islam. No, Muslims do not believe in the Bible. Yes, they believe that Jesus was a prophet, but they think that he was an islamic prophet who advocated the very same things Muhammad did but humans had corrupted his teachings.\n\nOh you mean totally unlike Islam? Fun fact: the Mughal empire in India killed 60-80 million Hindus. That's ten times worse than the holocaust! And who the hell taught you that the Catholic Church supported the Holocaust? That's a blatant lie. The Nazis opposed Catholicism and the Pope saved a few Jews.\n\n>You cannot argue that one religion is better than the other\n\nI can. You are a disgrace to atheism with your 'neutrality' which makes you an islamic apologist. **Christianity is lightyears ahead of Islam** \nAnd before you call me a christian fundamentalist: I'm an atheist too. \n\nAnd here we finally come to the same stupid argument you morons always bring up: muh standard of living\n\nHave you even thought a minute about this? Here let me redpill you: Those muslims who live in the west have a great life, but they still travel to a war-torn shithole named syria to fight for Allah. They reject a life in pure luxury because they want to die for Allah. Here's some more food for thought:\nSaudi Arabia is one of the richest countries in the world, but it also supports pretty much every single Sunni terrorist organisation.\n\n\n"}]}, "Body": "Have you also read the bible? God kicked humans out of the paradise for \"eating from the tree of knowledge\". And punished them (mostly by murdering them) whenever they didn't follow his orders to the letter. Would you call that a loving father-child relationship? \n(Just a fun fact: Muslims believe in the old and new testaments just as Christians do, with the exception that they don't believe that Jesus was God's son. They think he was a prophet like Moses, nonetheless everything good or bad in Christianity is also believed by Muslims)\nThe Spanish Inquisition was just one example, by the way. Countless wars were fought and European empires commited genocide after genocide in the name of god. Not to mention the Holocaust which was tacitly supported by the catholic church. \nYou cannot argue that one religion is better than the other. It's not true. What matters is what people do with their religion. And that is ultimately determined by their standard of living and how well they are accepted in a society.

The one thing the three major ones have in common is that everything, really everything is included in their religious texts. With Christianity you can have everything from your friendly neighborhood charity to the Spanish Inquisition. There's some pretty f*cked up shit in the bible. Same with Islam. You have people that listen to the well meaning parts of the religion and you have those who focus on the bad, the parts that justify terrorism. \nThat doesn't mean though that I think Islam is good. I'm an atheist who believes that religion is inherently bad. But I see that Islam is no worse than Christianity or Judaism or any other religion. And we do have freedom of religion which means that as a society we have to accept that there are people who follow religions that can be abused for extremist ideologies. \nThere are also [Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism) and [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_religious_terrorism) terrorists by the way.
