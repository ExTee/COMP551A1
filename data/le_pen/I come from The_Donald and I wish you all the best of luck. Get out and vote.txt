Some from the center (people who voted for Macron) will vote for Fillon, and some from the extreme left (M\u00e9lanchon voters) will vote for le Pen because they share a couple of things actually, being both kinda anti-systeme,  eurosceptics, and willing to cool things down with Russia. So she clearly has her chance here.\n\n\n- Marine vs Macron. Here I think Macron is most likely to win. I will vote blank because to me Macron is just too much of the same shit we got the last 20 year, but the guy is too consensual and Marine scares easily enough people in France to give him the support he needs to win.\n\n\n- Marine vs M\u00e9lanchon. This scenario is interesting because it puts the centrists in an awkward position, having to chose between two options seen as extreme. I'm expecting a lot of blank votes. I'm going for Melanchon here. I'm more concerned by the global warming than by the immigrants, to sum it up. Rising sea level is going to bring 10\u00d7 as much of them as the Syrian war, anyway. Plus in a sense global warming is partly responsible for this war too, it all started with an abnormal drought.\nBut I disgress. In this scenario aswell Marine has a very decent shot. Shes likely to get the votes from the right, M\u00e9lenchon is likely to get the votes from the left, and at the moment Fillon votes > Hamon votes. Plus she's extremely likely to get support from smaller candidates (Dupont-Aignan & Asselineau voters)\n\n\nAnyway I hope you'll appreciate my feedback more than you'll hate me for being openly a leftist. I'm not coming here to downvote, but out of curiosity.\n\nGo vote for Marine, that's only fair.
