The people are really warm and welcoming! I have a three of my Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois friends from there who are currently in long-term relationship with Frenchmen so it tells me that our French immigrants have an easy time integrating here :) For the American half, I really hope he speaks French otherwise he\u2019ll have a hard time. It is very much unilingual French (and/or deep joual). Historically, there was a huge English community, but a lot of them left in the 1970s and in 1989 (Ontario is literally next door). It still exists today, though I feel it\u2019s really tiny.\n\nIf you go live in Rouyn-Noranda, you *must* enjoy the outdoor activities. It\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, camping, swimming, skidoo, fishing, etc. I think it offers a better quality of life over Montr\u00e9al just for this, the outdoor and the space for your children to play. *Et de l\u2019air pur*. Houses aren\u2019t that expensive too when compared to Montr\u00e9al.\n\nOtherwise, the cultural scene is great. There is the film festival, the FME (festival de musique \u00e9mergente), a great theatre scene, plenty of shows. There is a c\u00e9gep and a university too. There are a few good restaurants and a microbrewery.\n\nRivi\u00e8re-Rouge is closer to Montr\u00e9al, but it seems like a no man\u2019s land to me (5,000 people). I passed through the town a few times, but there doesn't seems to be much to do there (except maybe look at the beautiful river). As for Montr\u00e9al, it is not the *best* place to raise children I feel. It's a huge city  of 4 million people with a lot of action. It depends if it's your vibe or not. Rouyn is only 40 000 people and much more quiet of a city.\n\nIf you have any other question don't hesitate. I live in Montr\u00e9al now.\n"}], "antithese_": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "I think you have pretty much summed the situation up, how much is 30% more money worth to you two. \n\nRouyn is a small town with \"some\" cultural aspect to it, but certainly not a cultural hub.\n\nRivi\u00e8re Rouge has basically nothing really worth living in for, you'll find yourself going to Mont Laurier / Mont Tremblant for any outings other then groceries. \n\nSome of the wild cards I could see is if you are both major nature type, do you like going fishing, hunting and such ? Do you want peace and quiet ? You do understand that not knowing French outside of Montr\u00e9al is going to be a huge burden for your integration ? \n\nUltimately, you already have all the elements to make a decision, you just have to decide what's important to the both of you."}], "SDION": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "If the goal is early retirement then really, the locale with a higher salary **and** lower cost of life is the obvious pick.\n\nThe question is \"do you want to live in the middle of nowhere\". The people might be friendly, it may be a surprisingly nice little town but make no mistake -- 90% of Canadians live 150km from the US border, you'll live over 500km away."}], "Marthnn": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Rouyn-Noranda is far, far to the north, a 5h drive further than Rivi\u00e8re-Rouge, which is at a 2h drive from Montreal. Of course, 2h is still quite far to regularly visit the Metropole, but there's a lot of nature to enjoy up there, close to Mont Tremblant, plus the costs of living are lower outside of Montreal I believe.\n\nTough choice. 5 years ago I would have gone for Rouyn-Noranda, 3 years ago for Rivi\u00e8re-Rouge, and currently I wouldn't budge from Montreal for double salary."}], "BastouXII": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "It depends what make each of you happy.
