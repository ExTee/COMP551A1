Ugly?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you mean dangerous. Sherbrooke has one of the lowest crime rates for a 100k+ town in probably all of North America so I wouldn't worry about that. If there's one murder every 5 years there, it's a big deal. You have to understand (and I'm gonna assume you're American based on your recent comment history... Yes I checked just to figure out where you were from) that in Quebec, besides from *some* parts of Montreal that are **kind of** \"not that nice\" (and even then I'm probably exaggerating), there is absolutely no place in Quebec that could ever be considered unsafe, especially by American standards... Actually probably even by Canadian standards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you mean boring, I'd say depending on your age you're gonna want to hang out in different parts of the town. If you're under 30 or even 35 if you're the party type I'd recommend the area around King and Wellington Streets. Lots of bars, cafes, restaurants, a theatre, etc. Sherbrooke is a college town and over 1/3 of the inhabitants are college students so it's pretty fun if you know where to go. If you're older I'd suggest the same part of town, but just not the same venues. Outside of the downtown though there is really not much to do and the place is somewhat boring. So ideally stick around the downtown.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd, I doubt you meant it like that, but just for the fun of answering that part, if you meant \"ugly\", then not really either. Sherbrooke as whole is just gorgeous, but if you start looking at each building individually, some of them, probably half, are ugly as shit lol. But as a whole it's a very nice, friendly and fun medium sized college town if you find the right place to hang out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFYI I lived there for 2 years as a college student before I transferred."}], "mgtown": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "You might pass through Magog when travelling in-between Sherbrooke and Mont-Orford.\n\nIn case you're not bilingual or phrase savvy, the outer edges of Magog are anglo. This is due to:\n\n- the trucks (and their stops) coming from the states\n- The retirement home where many bilinguals reside\n- The hospital, which needs to be\n- The south of the river has an English school, so basically all the English speaking families tend to live closer to the South.\n\nMost young people don't realize the town is actually a resort town geared to be elderly-friendly.
