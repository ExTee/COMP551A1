It can, but it can also lead to more evil.

According to this same logic then consequently \"intervention\" should lead to \"good\". In fact this is war rhetoric in disguise. Considering that the US \"intervened\" in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya and these ~~states~~ territories are now effectively war-zones torn apart by civil wars, **facts** support the premise that \"intervention\" leads to \"evil\" and consequently \"isolation\" leads to \"good\". Many people over the whole world feel that this applies strongly towards US ~~imperialism~~ foreign policy.\n\n> We have a moral imperative to do good where we can.\n\nI agree.
