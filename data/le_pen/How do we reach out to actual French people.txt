Twitter is coming along recently but hasn't yet the same pr\u00e9sence it has in the US.\n\n* a lot of the values and memes you are using can be taken the wrong way. \"Pedes\" is a slang for Fag and it's the first thing people notice usually. The green frog feels inoffensive to me but could be taken as an insult, depending on who you talk to. Weapons is a taboo, only the military has guns here, it feels out of place.\n\n* your strange focus on personal attacks to the opposite side feels very weird to me... we have lots of debates and can confront ideas, but take a look at our current president : physical traits of the president or is wife isn't something we vote for it seems.\n\nI participated in the \"shill post\" you described, and I also contacted your mods to understand the stance of this sub on dissent, as I want to understand both sides to make my decision.
