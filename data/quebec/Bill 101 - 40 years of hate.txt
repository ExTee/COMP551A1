When a province or a city is \u201cbilingual\u201d in Canada, it just means that the Anglos don\u2019t have to learn French.\n\nI never suggested a bilingual province. Sure, I mentioned a 50-50 arrangement in the English schools but that doesn't necessarily mean you get official bilingualism across the entire province. There aren't that many English schools! In addition, French itself could be promoted by enriching French, and demanding a greater proficiency, in all schools, both French and English ones, where anyone who doesn't display it simply does not graduate. There can also be limitations of funding where the English schools can only take so many students, with blockers put in place to prevent the \"elite schooling\" issue. These are all simple ideas. I'm sure there are a lot more creative ones.\n\n> We are always the ones trying to meet halfway, with the Anglophones rarely ever making the move towards us.\n\nPlease elaborate on this point.\n\n>  I have never been able to get a clear answer as to why they\u2019re opposed so much to independence. If they really felt Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, wouldn\u2019t they be more numerous to be in favour?\n\nThat's an easy one.\n\nThe English communities have suffered considerably and would have suffered much more if not for the lifeline called the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As I'm sure you know, the courts have struck down major elements of Quebec language legislation a few times over the years. Why would an independent Quebec cease pushing these types of legislation? Someone else here said not too long ago that the OQLF patrols would no longer be necessary if Quebec became a country. The English do not partake in that logic. So, in short, the English do not vote OUI because of what has been done to them over the years. They've been put into a state of suspended animation where they've been allowed to live but not thrive, watching their numbers dwindle, their schools close, one by one. Is it any wonder they feel separate and not part of the Quebec project? It's frankly disgusting. *This* is what L\u00e9vesque saw in Laurin's project. And that's why he walked out.\n\nI can now share with you a closely held secret. The anglophones who have been here for a few generations do not feel Canadian in the way most French Quebecois think they do. They've lived here a *long* time, and it's different here, so they are *by necessity* also quite different. But, as explained above, they also find it hard to say \"I am Quebecois\". This small group of people are quite unique. They do not have a country to call their own. If asked \"Are you Canadian?\", they will say they are, because it seems like the logical thing to say, and they have to say something. They are actually quite apolitical (sure we have a few loudmouths), vote Liberal when it's time, and try to go on living the best they can in this surreal situation."}]}, "Body": "> the damage that it has unnecessarily inflicted upon the English communities that I'm talking about.\n\nWhat I am trying to explain is that this damage was necessary. I don\u2019t think we could have gotten the same results any other way. Bilingualism doesn\u2019t work to protect a linguistic minority, it has been proven time and time again. When a province or a city is \u201cbilingual\u201d in Canada, it just means that the Anglos don\u2019t have to learn French. We are always the ones trying to meet halfway, with the Anglophones rarely ever making the move towards us.\n\nTo have an officially unilingual province *created* the incentive to learn French. As a result, young Anglo-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are more implicated than ever in our cultural life and finally mix with the Francophones. *Everyone* meet halfway here. It\u2019s not idyllic, it\u2019s not perfect, and we could mix a lot more, but I think it\u2019s as good as it gets in a multilingual country. We're doing a pretty good job.\n\n>Since when do French Quebecois give much of a thought about those French communities anyway? \n\nWell, for one I *do* think about them all the time, to the point of obsession. But you\u2019re right, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois like me are rare. Bringing them up just help us compare what the situation is like in the rest of Canada regarding the linguistic minority rights. It helps us understand what can happen within the federal frame if there are no language planning, insufficient ones or ill-suited ones. Though it\u2019s hard to compare in the Qu\u00e9bec case... Because English is not really in danger at all and is even menacing our language (and a lot of other ones throughout the world). It forces us to take a hardline approach we wouldn\u2019t have to take if you spoke Romanian for instance. \n\n>Continuing on the above line of thinking, those who seek independence constantly fall into the same trap. They seem to dislike Canada and want to do things on their own but they constantly bring up Canada when dealing with the English in Quebec and spiral down into the same resentment and vindictiveness. In the end, the Quebec English get stomped on. They should try to see English people in Quebec as what they are: actual Quebecois, and treat them as they should, as brothers. There are solutions to promote French without destroying these communities but if the English people are seen as the enemy I don't see much of a way forward.\n\nFor better and for worse, we are still part of Canada, and it seems we will be for a little longer. It means that our linguistic precariousness as a minority will continue to be a central issue and we will continue to feel uneasy with English, and I said *English*, not *Anglophones*. We shouldn\u2019t amalgamate the two.\n\nI do have this \u201cresentment and vindictiveness\u201d issue a bit. It has been exacerbated by my going to the r/Canada sub to get insulted and learning extensively about Qu\u00e9bec history (and hum hum, maybe r/Qu\u00e9bec circle jerk a bit). I, and I think some other Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois too, have some trouble turning the page with the Anglos. The wounds are still fresh, it wasn\u2019t too long ago that we were treated as second-class citizens. Sometimes it was our parents themselves who lived the discrimination. Some people say that we *enjoy* victimizing ourselves... I don\u2019t think we do. We just want to stay ultra-aware of our history, and avoid reliving the same thing. *Je me souviens* and all that. It doesn\u2019t help either that English-Canadians from the RoC continue to treat us as utter shit, it reflects badly on Anglo-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois even though it have nothing to do with you (or rather most of you).\n\nIt\u2019s stupid but I think that the *one thing* that could really calm the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois down, and get them to be more tolerant with the English community is the *one thing* that they would never consider doing in a million years: voting for independence. \n\nC\u2019est peut-\u00eatre ce climat toxique dont tu parles qui repousse les Anglos du projet, but who knows. I have never been able to get a clear answer as to why they\u2019re opposed so much to independence. If they *really* felt Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, wouldn\u2019t they be more numerous to be in favour? That said, je suis d\u2019accord que le mouvement souverainiste doit vraiment essayer de se r\u00e9inventer en ce moment pour \u00eatre plus rassembleur. Ce climat toxique est un terreau fertile pour tous les extr\u00eames et nous emp\u00eache d\u2019avancer en tant que nation (et dans ma nation, il y a les Anglo-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et les N\u00e9o-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, pour autant qu\u2019ils se consid\u00e8rent de notre peuple).\n"}], "sammmuel": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "The comparison with the French in the RoC is apt. Because it goes to show how much is done for English in Quebec.\n\nIt is not an exageration to say that the English in Qu\u00e9bec are one of the luckiest small minorities in the world, with world-class universities, hospitals, government services of high quality (having dealt with Ontario french services, Qu\u00e9bec has stellar english services) as well as well-funded school boards. All that with a very low share of the population (around what, 6 or 7 percent, from memory?). That is exceptional by world standards. Yet, we just get shit on all the time for not doing enough.\n\nThe French in Ontario have at best a bilingual hospital they had to fight to keep and bilingual universities that try to reduce French continuously (university of Ottawa has continuously been reducing its offering in French). \n\nIts a valid point of comparison because despite the complaints of anglophones, they are extremely-well treated. I understand you feel it is at time ghettoised but frankly, I am just not seeing many anglophones attempt to move elsewhere in Qu\u00e9bec even if they could receive all important services in English.
