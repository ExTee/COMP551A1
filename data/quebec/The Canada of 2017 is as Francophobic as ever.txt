French was the \"bird\" course and not many people wanted to pick up on it unless encouraged by an outside force aka parents/guardians. \n\nThere's probably more avenues to give easier access to public services for francophones outside of quebec but I would not even know where to start with giving suggestions there.

As a quick peek into life when you're a minority, visit Quebec and come see small towns not near Quebec city or Montreal - there is a higher chance they speak little english. You'll quickly find the daunting task of being a minority. Now imagine you requesting these people pay tax in order to fund signage for you. Is it fair? It would be no different than require public signage in french in Toronto. The thing is, there are a minority element of francophones in Ontario, and Manitoba. These people go through life in english despite it not being their language. So the majority over time have adopted english as their primary language through convenience. Now I dont think anyone would say Ontario explicitly is trying to assimilate french people in 2017, but a byproduct of unilingual language services, signage, and education is they are. So should we strive for bilingualism even though it serves ~5% of the population (I'm making the number up)? Well that would depend, but one thing for sure if we were to properly adopt it; and I believe we should, it would increase the number of bilingual speakers.

It's definitely a grey area because almost everything we have in writing has a French version, signs, warnings, instructions, announcements are said in english and french etc.. there are French immersion schools here but I'm not sure if they're public, most likely not. That stereotype of the RoC having negative opinions of Quebec is sad but true. In my opinion, i feel like the RoC is trying to be accommodating, but it's hard to give a valuable opinion when I'm not French and have not experienced how the public and govt act towards me if I were. Again thanks for your input."}]}, "Body": "As you may imagine, the answer is yes and no. A lot of folks will have different opinions on it, so I'll just share mine.\n\nIn **Quebec**: no, if anything it's the opposite: anglophones and allophones are \"oppressed\" - note I use the word lightly because it's a very grey area; francophones will say anglos are given a large amount of special privilege for a minority (which is true especially comparing to allophones - you can get many government services in english, education, ect) and that english is no more targeted than any other language (other than french). Anglophones will say english is targeted constantly and they face discrimination in work place and even from the government itself. Funnily enough on the topic of education english have **more** rights over french people since the anglophones have a choice of attending english schools or french schools whereas francophones are forced to attend only french. The irony here is that the government in an attempt to preserve french is restricting francophones. English is easy to attack as it is the dominant minority language. Depending where you get your information, you can read stories of bus drivers punching english speaking clientele just as easy as you may read about francophones being unable to get any service in french. \n\nThe reason why this may seem confusing is because of historical reasons: french was suppressed for a good 200 years leading up to the Quiet Revolution. Anglophone immigrants flooded Quebec and many towns were founded or shaped by english speaking folk. The francophones maintain that Quebec is the only french speaking place in North America and as such french *should* be predominant in all things which a special emphasis over english - which to be fair they have a point. The anglophones maintain that the english are to be \"protected\" as a special minority because they have contributed much to Quebec's current history. Which side is right? They both are IMO. Thus the tricky situation. Why should a francophone be unable to have service in his or her language in their own province ? Similarly, why should an anglophone be forced to acquise and not get services in english if they're family have been here in the province for over 100 years? Thus a sticky situation. Anglophones and francophones older than 50 will certainly remember hostilities and systematic separation (it begins at school) and thus older generations will harbour resentment and refuse cooperation. They also have a higher % of monolinguals. Young Quebecois today like myself are fully bilingual and more and more don't see language issues as major - we often use \"franglais\" where a sentence will contain both english and french. The populations are more intermingled as well and hopefully this will be a continuing trend - I (and yes I am anglo) can relate more to a Quebecois of any language preference over a non Quebecois Canadian despite sharing a language with the RoC. Finally Quebecois sovereignists (nationalist the right word?) have historically wanted to \"erase\" or diminish english importance in the history of Quebec. Fortunately today I believe this is no longer the case as those extreme voices are being shoved into irrelevance and their aims revolve around a more inclusion independant Quebec though even that movement is waning. \n\n**For Canada**\n\nI believe there is still a systematic oppression towards french in Canada - its very easy to speak to a non Quebecois Canadian and find out they \"hate the damn french\" or something like that despite never even spoken to a Quebecois more than a few minutes. Just yesterday I was in Toronto and when a gentlemen inquired where I was from he was shocked to discover I lived in Montreal despite having \"excellent english\". He was even more surprised when I told him english is my primary language - I rolled my eyes in his ignorance - I believe RoC knows very little of Quebec as is evidenced through my experience and your post. The question we need to ask ourselves: why? Im not blaming you of course, but your exposure is limited and I believe its the fault of the government. With exception of New Brunswick which supposedly have a strong french minority (never been idk), the RoC sucks at welcoming and promoting french. Can you are as a Torontonian walk into a hospital and get a french speaking doctor? Or attend a school in all french? I fundamentally believe if we are truly to be a bilingual country, we should reflect it. There is no reason why Canada cannot be semi bilingual - there is even historical precedence as french speakers dominated the regions from Manitoba all the way to the Atlantic provinces before english arrivals. The history side of things is that in the 200 years since the transfer of colonies from France to Great Britain, the British systematically wiped out all french except in Quebec. So now the question is, should the government re-institute french in some random town in northern Ontario despite not a citizen speaking french? It seems crazy, doesn't it? In my opinion, every province east of Saskatchewan should be bilingual. There is no reason we can't do it, many europeans know 3-5 languages, yet we cannot even master 2? Is it worth pursuing? \n\nI hope this helps you understand a little better :) "}]}, "Body": "As an English speaking Torontonian, is there any sort of systemic oppression targeted towards francophones outside and in Quebec ?
