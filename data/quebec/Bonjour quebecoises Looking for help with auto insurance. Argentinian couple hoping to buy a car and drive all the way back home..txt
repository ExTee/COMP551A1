I'm not sure either if there is currently a ferry running between the two countries either."}], "T9C-gars": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "You need specialty auto (and possibly medical) insurance.  There are not many companies, in any country, who insure like this.  In Canada one of the main auto insurers like this is Clay-Robinson.  Their underwriters may vary, but at this point in time, State Farm insurance may be the underwriter.\n\n[CR's main Canadian office is in Calgary](http://www.profilecanada.com/companydetail.cfm?company=2021224_Clay-robinson_Ltd_Calgary_AB).  Tell them you'll be transporting / driving a Canadian registered vehicle  transborder outside of the US, Canada and Mexico, and that you require insurance for Central and South America.  Because you are not Canadian citizens, they may direct you to deal with their underwriters directly (they can provide the appropriate contact info for this specialized insurance). \n\nEdit:  If CR won't insure you because you're not Canadian (and they may not), one of the very few other options is [Clements & Co. from the UK](https://www.clements.com/intl-car).   The Canadian Foreign Service, and the foreign services of many other countries (possibly even Argentina's *Canciller\u00eda/Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto*) actually instruct their overseas employees (who take their vehicles with them) to insure with Clements when they are posted to developing countries and in the event those host countries will not provide local auto insurance to expats (Clements even insures in places like North Korea and Syria).  The closest Clements office for you to contact would be [Washington, DC](https://www.clements.com/contact).  They can insure you by phone and email.\n\nUpon giving them the list of countries you intend to travel through, you will need to tell them that you need the minimum dollar value coverage for the most stringent country on your list (I believe Brazil may be the most stringent in the Americas for North American vehicles.  Upon entry to Brazil, they may request you present your minimum liability coverage for a Canadian vehicle at the border before allowing you to enter... unless you intend to go the long way around via Ecuador-Peru-Chile... Check with the insurance company which is the most stringent country).\n\nIn addition, upon border crossing anywhere south of Mexico, you may be asked by various Latin American border officials to provide proof of valid international medical insurance specific to occupants of a Canadian registered vehicle, regardless of your citizenship.  Very few Canadian insurance companies provide this.  The main one, if not the only one, is TIC medical insurance, which I believe has become Allianz Global Assistance.  [Their main office for all of Canada is in ~~Toronto~~ Edit: Kitchener, Ontario] (http://www.allianz-assistance.ca/en/contact.aspx).  Otherwise Clements can also tack a medical rider onto the auto insurance.\n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck, and drive safe.

And your insurance has to cover, as a mininum coverage, the other parties involved in any accident.

You don't have to cover your own damages to your own car however."}], "allo12": [{"Replies": {"tharosbr0": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Thanks, I didn't think about that option.
