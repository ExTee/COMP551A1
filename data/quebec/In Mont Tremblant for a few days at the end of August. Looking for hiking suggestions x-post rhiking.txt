I suggest to you ''Le centenaire'' and ''Le To\u00eet-Des-Laurentides'', they're the two trails with the best view, imo. The ''d\u00e9nivel\u00e9'' (height difference between the summit and the base) are respectively 430 meters and 600 meters. They're both classified as ''difficult'', but if you've hiked a few times in your life, it shouldn't be a problem. Le Centenaire takes around 4-5 hours (we did it in 4) and Le To\u00eet takes around 6(we did it in 5 including various breaks)."}], "kchoze": [{"Replies": {"DJTrav": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Great reply, Thank you"}]}, "Body": "There are multiple paths to the summit, they all give you wonderful views of the region and, though they are not walks in the park, since you're climbing most of the time, they're not that hard. I tend to go climb the mountain on foot once a year or so, and once brought my 60-year-old mother to do the climb with me, she's pretty fit but still, she did the climb. The only issue we had was with a temporary deviation in a steep ski trail while the sun was hitting hard, but that was just that year, now all paths are essentially all under the leaves.\n\nIf you want an easier time, you can also just take the gondola to the summit and come down the mountain rather than climb it.\n\nThere are a few paths around the mountain which are even easier, but they tend to be pretty short.\n\nThere are bike paths too that some people walk, there's the \"P'tit Train du Nord\" bike trail, an old rail line, you can rent a bike and go travel alongside it, and you can go as far as you want on it, it stretches for dozens of kilometers north and south, connecting most towns in the region. Or you can try walking it if you want an easy hiking trail."}]}, "selftext": "[r/hiking original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/6uvfs2/in_mont_tremblant_for_a_few_days_at_the_end_of/)", "suggested_sort": null}
