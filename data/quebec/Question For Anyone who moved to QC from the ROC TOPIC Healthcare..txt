I just wanted to add that the three month period is calculated only need on the month during which you arrive. If you arrive at the end of a month, that whole month counts in the three month period. For example, I arrived in Quebec on May 25 and started being covered by RAMQ at the beginning of August. So if it's possible for you to organize something like that, you will be able to cut down the three month period to two months. Good luck!"}]}, "Body": "Well I'm originally from QC, moved to ON and back so I had to switch both ways. The only answer I can say is, it varies. Some doctors/hospitals will take other provinces' health insurance directly but some won't. Depending on the province, they might not pay all of it (for example, RAMQ will only cover up to how much they would reimburse for a service in QC) so you might have to cover some. Hospitals tend to be a bit better at taking it directly but it depends on which one. A regional hospital might not since it's not worth having to register with each provincial health insurance board for a few cases while larger hospitals/those that get more ROC patients might be more inclined to. I had to go to the doctor (not hospital) in both QC and ON while covered by the other province and in both cases I had to pay out of pocket.
