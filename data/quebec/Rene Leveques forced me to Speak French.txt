It meant that we could *finally* have access to higher-ranking jobs and have a chance at economic success. In almost all spheres, Francophones took the vacant spots of the cowardly Anglophones who left. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois created new companies and could finally work in French. Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque was godsend.\n\nWe're never going to go back to being the \"economic capital\" of Canada, but to me it's a good deal if it means a fairer society. Also, I don't know, Toronto seems soulless to me too. Montr\u00e9al has art, it has heart.
