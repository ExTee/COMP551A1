A short work week can be combined with a culture of hard work, and no one has to \"pay\" for anyone else to exist. Iirc there was a recent experiment from a nordic country to have a 6 hour work day, and it found people crammed about as much productivity into that time frame.\n\nContrast with Japan, which has a culture of incredibly long hours and hard work and a huge suicide rate.\n\nIt seems like there's a happy middle ground somewhere in there.  There's an idea that a shorter workweek can allow someone more time with friends or family (or just rest and relaxation) leading to a more refreshed and happy worker.  Happy workers tend to be very productive.\n\nWhere are you going to school?  In Europe?  You probably have a much better handle on the upcoming point than I do, but I was under the impression that schooling is *incredibly* subsidized (depending on the country, I'm sure).  My understanding of this, combined with your earlier remark of \"not expecting others to pay for your existence\", sounds like you're not really practicing what you're preaching. \n\nI'm sure you're not particularly lazy.  Maybe as lazy as ordinary people, but probably less."}]}, "Body": "A culture of a short week keeps down productivity and makes the country poorer as a whole, wouldn't you say?
