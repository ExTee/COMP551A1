The Political Compass has long pointed out that left and right essentially describe economics. Macron, for example, is regularly reported as being economically \u2018liberal\u2019 and socially \u2018left wing\u2019. In reality, Macron is a classic libertarian in the US sense, with a socially liberal outlook and, crucially, an extreme right wing (ie neoliberal) economic agenda. This mix appeals to a significant section of younger voters who, being steadfastly pro-business, dislike most forms of state engagement in either the economy or society in general. He\u2018s certainly the closest of the candidates to Social Darwinism.\n\n>Le Pen is similarly misrepresented as \u2018extreme right wing\u2019. Her extemism is in her social attitudes, not her economics. Indeed France\u2019s National Front has often been economically to the left of the pre-Hamon Socialist Party in its attachment to the public sector and opposition to globalisation and privatisation. The party, with its strong strain of nationalism, might well be described as a form of national socialism.\n\n>Fillon, unlike Macron, marries conservative social policies with neoliberal economics; but this most establishment of the candidates is dogged with an undignified judicial enquiry that undermines his moral authority.\n\n>Hamon\u2019s attempts to portray himself as different from the market-friendly Hollande Socialist Party may not convince a sufficient number of its disappointed core supporters. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s unpredicted surge in support reflects his appeal as an anti-establishment candidate of the uncompromising left at a time when the political establishment \u2014 and neoliberalism \u2014 are widely disliked. However, he cut France\u2019s left-wing voters adrift by refusing an alliance with Hamon which, according to the results, would have meant a Socialist government after the first round. M\u00e9lenchon must have noted the pre-election opinion polls indicating this strong possibility, yet he apparently preferred a Macron or Le Pen government to one which saw him in dominant alliance with the Socialist Party. His baffling decision has eliminated the possibility of an anti-neoliberal (ie anti-globalisation) government with liberal social policies.\n\n>Now French voters face a choice of a pro-globalisation government with liberal social policies (Macron) or an anti-globalisation government with illiberal social policies (Le Pen). Since Le Pen\u2019s economic attitudes are far closer to socialism than Macron\u2019s, a significant number of dismayed, and inevitably angry, former M\u00e9lenchon supporters will hold their noses, vote Front National \u2026 and perhaps not admit it."}], "BootsanPants": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "What makes her Authoritarian?
