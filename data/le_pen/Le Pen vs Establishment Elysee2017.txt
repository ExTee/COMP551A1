He chose not to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is very telling that the MSM and unions in France (syndicats) are falling over themselves in their effusive praise of Macron. He even believes he has it in the bag. Saying \"As President, I will do XYZ\". Funnily enough, Marine said \"That's OK, I prefer to have the support of the French people, instead\". Don't count your chickens before they hatch. Indeed, some newspaper articles in papers like La Libre, a Belgian newspaper, have appeared asking him what he thinks he is doing celebrating his first-round victory in a fancy Parisian restaurant, as thought he's won the Presidency. These articles are saying in a nutshell that this is providing grain for Marine to mill, and are also novice mistakes."}]}, "Body": "Bit ironic considering Le Pen's father was more of a Nazi than everyone in this picture combined."}]}, "selftext": "", "suggested_sort": null}
