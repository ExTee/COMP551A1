Vintimiglia is in Italy and over there the booze and the cigarettes are pretty cheap compared with France. Food is excellent as well ( pizzeria due palme). I think if you go on Friday morning it's very busy because of the \"March\u00e9\" which is like a giant market where you can buy food and other stuff (fake brands as well). So be advised that it will be packed on Friday.\n\nIf you like soccer you can go the Stade Louis II in Monaco to watch Monaco, it's not too expensive I think and the team is better than OGC Nice."}], "thrawninioub": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "- In Nice, have a walk through the old town, walk up the chateau to have a panoramic view, and see if you have time to go to the Mont Boron, also a nice panoramic view of the different valleys part of the city. \nIn the evening, you HAVE to go eat at Pipo, it's the best Socca in town. http://www.chezpipo.fr/  You can't book, you need to go and wait for your turn. \n\nThere is a nice place toward the west of promenade des Anglais : http://www.parc-phoenix.org/.\n\n- Monaco is only a 30 minute train travel. The old city on \"Le Rocher\" with the Mus\u00e9e Oc\u00e9anographique (big aquarium and sea related museum, one of the previous Princes was a famous sea guy and explorer). Behind the casino there's a nice garden with a chance to see cool expensive cars that you may not see often otherwise. In the evening Planet Pasta is a nice restaurant with homemade Pasta and sauces, nothing fancy but hearty and cheap, otherwise everything is expensive and tourist traps.  Again no booking in advance possible. There is no Grand Prix or rally at this time, so the ugly metal stands should be out of the way. \n\n- Villefranche is a great beach and honestly the bay is one of the most beautiful landscape I've seen in France. You can catch a glimpse in the train going to monaco. \n\n- Eze is a nice little village but without a car it can be a bit tricky to go there. ther's a perfume factory that you can visit, Fragonard.\n\n\n\nThe countryside is great to go hiking, it's the thing I miss most now that I left the homeland. La Colmiane and Le Bor\u00e9on are two prime examples.
