If it were published too far in advance, excuses or plausible denial could be manufactured for the information while at the same time, the leaker might be determined and put to death.    \n   \nInstead of looking at the circumstances of the leak - the questions should be regarding legitimacy of the information (which you do raise) and whether the presented information makes sense.   For example- corruption usually necessitates large amounts of money or power changing hands either now, or promised in the future.   This is difficult to assess in such a short time.   \n   \nIn my experience, the most devastating problems usually turn out to be former insiders. Someone close to Macron who lost their job, or a promotion they expected that was given to another.   It becomes a personal vendetta.  Just as some people unwisely choose physical violence to get revenge, the former insider(s) will do anything to get their revenge.   \n    \nDo you know if there were any blackmail threats or allegations made against Macron in the months leading up to the election?  If someone had been asking him for money to remain silent and he didn't pay up - then a late release would make good sense.    \n  \nOne suggestion I do have is that if it is an inside leaker, that person will likely be discovered very quickly, and either questioned by the authorities or die in questionable circumstances.  If neither of these two things happen in the next few months, then it is less likely to be a single insider and more likely a collaborative effort from outside."}]}, "Body": "If there was anything damning in these leaks, why wouldn't they have been leaked weeks ago when the media could have torn macron apart over them?\n\nCheck /r/france.

Odds are only good for generalizing over large quantities.  It would be better to ask if Macron/Le Pen has made many enemies -which I would suspect almost any politician has done.  Then I would ask if Macron/Le Pen gave internal and external enemies ripe opportunities for leaking information.    \n   \nThe timing of the leak would be attempted to maximize political impact, regardless of whether the leaker was an individual, independent group or a government.   The timing is like people going to the beach during the summer - it tells us very little.   \n   \nAs regards the US leaks - several members of Ms Clinton's team were given immunity from prosecution.   Prosecutors don't grant immunity to people who have nothing to hide.   \n  \nLastly, why would Twitter, Archive.org and other sites censor and hide the information if it were merely lies?  The best way to expose a lie is to hold it up to the light, not hide it in the corner.
