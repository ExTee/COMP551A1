The place she is mainly staying in is south of Toulouse so she's really nowhere near Paris most of the time. However, she has stayed near or in Paris many times and she has seen nothing of car-burnings or anything like that. However, she has only been in France since August, so she did miss all of the violence this last Summer and over the past years.\n\nI also know four other people, mostly sisters of close friends who are literally staying *in Paris* and have been for months, or in some cases, years. (Just for some background, I'm traditional Catholic and a lot of this traveling stuff is through the Dominican Sisters and their convent in France. My sister for example is teaching elementary school over there.) Everyone I know says that yes, there is a lot of unrest, and thank God none of them have been in any of the attacks, but they all say that the reactionary stuff such as the car-burnings and whatnot are very well handled, and much more far-between than is reported. So from that I gather that it's not as huge a problem as the United States media is making it out to be. Add all this to the absolutely abominable way they covered the US election and you've got yourself a right pickle over who the hell even to believe any more. Not to say that it's not a problem over there, but I doubt it's something that should realistically be a major campaign point in French politics, and the fact that English-speaking media is harping on it so much makes me *very* distrustful of any conclusions drawn from it.\n\nAs far as dealing with Islam, she has said multiple times that it is Islamic Fundamentalism that she is dead-set against, and she has no problem with Islam as a religion as long as it is practiced with respect for France's national culture.\n\nIf any French person could correct me or let me know what's up, that would be fantastic.

I don't know if you are sarcastically dissing her policies or if you're legitimately offering criticism. From what I gather, her policies for dealing with Domestic Terrorism is to try to find and prosecute the criminals as any other mass-scale criminal would be prosecuted. The issue about immigration is that with the wide-open borders that France has now, it makes it much, *much* harder to actually keep track of who is coming, in, who is leaving, etc., which in turn makes it much harder to find and prosecute domestic terrorists.\n\nNot to mention that not *all*, and I would venture to say *very few* of the terrorists were actually French citizens.
