Here you can see her say specifically:  \"il me manque 6 millions d'euros.\" https://youtu.be/TuRBI21C4UM\n\nThe problem is not that some banks refused to loan to her because of past bad actors in other parties. It's the fact that ALL the French banks refused her a loan, while candidates from parties that have been implicated in fraude (unlike the FN where no charges have been filed, no convictions achieved for fraude) stil make out ok. Despite the entire shit storm from the Sarkozy fallout, I don't see a problem for his former PM when he looks for a loan. M\u00e9lenchon, Bayrou, Macron, Dupont-Aignan, none of them seem to be running into these blockades. You're telling me that the candidate who has never presided over financial scandal, and is going to win the highest vote percentage is too risky to lend to? But not Sarkozy's ex-PM or a PS candidate that could potentially not even break 5%? Give me a break. \n\nNow...When every financial institution in the host country denies you a loan, obliging you to look elsewhere, people like the originator of this thread look like complete and utter jackasses. She didn't go to a Russian bank to sell French influence there, she went there because she had no other viable lender. Perhaps president Trump knows some American lenders that will help her out, and we can out the Russian boogeyman to bed. Her Russian loan is a completely bogus criticism, seeing as how she exhausted every other option before doing it. "}]}, "Body": "> The loan she is asking for is \u20ac6 million\n\nAny source on that? Because [6 million euros](http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/marine-le-pen-aura-bien-les-sous-de-papa-31-12-2016-6510198.php) is the amount that the FN is going to borrow to Jean-Marie Le Pen (or more exactly to a micro-party under JM control), which will cover around half the cost for the presidential. However it's not the amount she wanted to borrow in the first place. [Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/120916/presidentielle-le-fn-est-la-recherche-de-financements-l-etranger?onglet=full) for example has some information about a number above 23 millions euros (being a million more than the maximum spending allowed for the presidential assuming she goes to the 2nd round).\n\n\n>  don't you find it a little curious that they only seem to make people uncomfortable when they relate to the FN,\n\nI don't because they don't. The UMP has some problems with banks following their disastrous campaign management. It was also a , somewhat brief, talking point against certain candidates in the LR (ex-UMP) primary, \"les emplois fictifs\" of Paris mayor are particularly well known. Cahuzac (ex PS minister) just got a 3 years prison sentence, even if it wasn't involving the party directly it's still not making the party look good.\n\n>  and that they never seem to turn up anything?\n\nThey do find something. The investigations are most likely overblown by political opponent so the findings are minors compared to what has been sold but it doesn't mean there wasn't anything worth investigating. \n\n> But nobody bats an eyelash st the countless UMP escroqueries,\n\nAlready answered that. No they don't, themselves included. Bygmalion was a huge investigation that kept the media interest for years and so are many of the others investigation on Sarkozy  (or Cop\u00e9 at the time).\n\n>  the r\u00e9publicains still get loans no problem. \n\nAgain, no they don't. [July 2015 \"Why banks are wary of politicians\"](http://www.europe1.fr/politique/pourquoi-les-banques-se-mefient-des-partis-politiques-1366506) an article talking, among other things, of a meeting between all (expect the FN) the parties' treasurers to talk about the difficulties they have to get loans.  [Another one from April 2016](http://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/Pourquoi-les-banques-ne-pretent-plus-aux-politiques-783059) with notably a number of large banks flat out refusing loans to political parties. \n\nA lot of the current difficulties can be blamed on Sarkozy and the shit fest that happened following the 2012 campaign but still the difficulties are touching all parties and the less safe the party looks the harder it hit them, as it would be for literally any person or entity wanting to borrow money.\n\n> For fuck's sake, even Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon recognizes how absurd this loan situation is. He's able to finance his campaign and he will not make it to round two at all.\n\nFinally something true, that's a nice change. \n"}]}, "Body": "The loan she is asking for is \u20ac6 million.

The FN never really raised found using his members which is the traditional guarantee of reimbursement (see Sarkozy/UMP when campaign finance was invalidated by the Conseil Constitutionnel). Given that only half of the maximum campaign spending are cover by the government (nobody doubting she will do the necessary 5% for it) it begs the question as to how the other 50% are going to be financed.\n\nIf we add to that the fact that the system in place to fund the FN (Cotelec and similar) are pretty obscure and that the relationship between Marine and her father, which is still heavily involved with those micro-party) isn't exactly the best the banks have serious reasons to have some reserve. What happened to the UMP alone made them more prudent than before.\n\nIf that wasn't enough there are multiple investigations concerning the FN that could endangered an paying back the loan. Some of them are on 2012 campaign founds and some other are on using European Parliament's assistant in way they wouldn't have (basically as employees of the party rather than what they are supposed to be) and other similar illegal things.\n\nAll taken together the FN present a serious risk for banks.\n\n>  Far less popular candidates have had no problem securing loans.\n\nI'm wondering which far less popular candidate**S** aren't having any problem raising the kind of money Le Pen is looking for."}], "[Deleted]": [{"Replies": {"PourQueViveLaFrance": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "What rhetoric would that be?
