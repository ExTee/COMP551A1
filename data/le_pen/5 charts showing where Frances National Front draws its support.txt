Look at your first comment up there, you were talking about \"NF\" not \"Le Pen\".\n\nSecond, your poll (as if poll had any value in current year + 2, but let's assume they have some) says that for the French, Marine Le Pen is a \"danger to Democracy\". Hell, what does that mean ? That she won't be elected (making your nonsensical assertion of \"NF will be elected\" up there completely stupid), or that she is elected by people who are against democracy ? In both cases, people won't regret their choice since they'll get what they want.\n\nThird, your inability at elementary school-grade logics does not take into account that the FN has never been at the higher positions of the French State.
