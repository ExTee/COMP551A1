It's not a special interest trying to capitalize on a crisis for it's own benefits at the detriment of the French people. It's partners in Freedom helping each other stand up on their own. Very similar to WW2; the foreign influence was from the Germans- actually dictating how France needs to be run etc. The foreign help came from the Allies freeing France from that foreign influence and then stepping back and letting the France be France.
