This year, I realized that I might be eligible for an exemption of tax due to my researcher status.

I only found out I was not taxed this year when they told me to look for my invoice on my online account.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s my questions. Do I try to come clean and ask them to reinvestigate my case? Do I move on with my life hoping that they will not come back and tax me? If they find out, will they apply a late payment penalty on me?

I'm not really well informed regarding this kind of situation, but this is my gut feeling. If you come clean and attach your correspondance with the tax office (the ones who told you to just put 0\u20ac), they will normaly assume that you acted in good faith and should not apply penalty.\n\nYou can send them an e-mail via the website, they answer quite quickly\n\nEdit: important question: how were you made aware that you were not eligible for the tax exemption ?"}], "boa13": [{"Replies": {"JirachiJirachi": [{"Replies": {"boa13": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "> Did you get a later payment date for this?\n\nNo, I got a later reimbursement.\n\nI had successfully applied for a partial exemption of the amount I had to pay, but I still had the original (incorrect) *avis d'imp\u00f4t* to pay.

This happened to me for my *taxe d'habitation*.\n\n> Do I try to come clean and ask them to reinvestigate my case?\n\nI think this is the most responsible thing to do, also the least stressful in the long run. It is also entirely possible they maintain the current situation (0 taxable income) and give their reasoning in doing so. At worst you'll pay what you were supposed to pay.\n\n> Do I move on with my life hoping that they will not come back and tax me?\n\nEntirely possible, many people would do so, but this can be stressful and nag you for some years. Is it worth the price?\n\n> If they find out, will they apply a late payment penalty on me?\n\nQuite possible. They are generally willing to waive the penalties on honest first time mistakes (though only if you ask in writing), but since you already asked about your situation, they may consider you were informed.\n\nSomeone else suggested that you open an account on their website, this wil indeed allow you to keep current on your situation (see your past declarations, and their tax notifications).
