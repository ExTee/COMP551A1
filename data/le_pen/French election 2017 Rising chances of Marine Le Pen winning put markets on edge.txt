Evolution put that response there for a reason. If women were inherently better at leading a group than men it would be reasonable to assume the tribes with female leaders would thrive alongside those who recognised their good leadership and followed their rule. Over the generations those who resisted would be culled from the pool in one fashion or another leaving us with a matriarchal society. This isn't the case. Women are bad leaders. You may resent me for saying that and it wouldn't surprise me. It's exactly that kind of behavior that makes women bad leaders. They have a much harder time accepting things as they are enough to make informed decisions. No, women excel in other areas than leadership. It isn't a matter of equality any more than a man can conceive a child.

If Le Pen wins, it seems like she'd be pretty favorable to both the US and Russia, and also the UK if they continue down the Brexit path. Ironically it will only be Germany that would cause a problem, not because of German nationalism, but because of anti-nationalism/pro-EU.\n\n>This same scenario is what led up to WW1 in Europe.\n\nIt's really a lot more complicated than that. WWI origins research is over a century old and the debate is still not settled. The consensus today seems to be that every country has some culpability, and it appears that the war gave them all an excuse to use force to settle old scores and not be seen as obvious aggressors. I'm sure France didn't really care about the Austrian-Serbian conflict, instead caring much more about revenge against Prussia and the retaking of Alsace and Lorraine.\n\nI think the bigger cause of WWI was imperialism and rivalry between empires rather than nationalism. Keep in mind, too, that the nationalism of early 20th century was a *centralizing* nationalism (Germany and Italy were new countries, just before they were decentralized polities). Today nationalism is *decentralizing*, against the EU, against international power structures."}], "Alternate_Flurry": [{"Replies": {"studentthrowaway1": [{"Replies": {"Alternate_Flurry": [{"Replies": {"studentthrowaway1": [{"Replies": {"Alternate_Flurry": [{"Replies": {"studentthrowaway1": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "https://www.amazon.com/Prisoners-Geography-Explain-Everything-About/dp/1501121464\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Revenge-Geography-Coming-Conflicts-Against/dp/1400069831/ref=pd_sim_14_1/145-9649370-7593421?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1400069831&pd_rd_r=2T9333X1RTSTPRTN8BVX&pd_rd_w=B0Iug&pd_rd_wg=mrRgQ&psc=1&refRID=2T9333X1RTSTPRTN8BVX"}]}, "Body": "Democracies very rarely attack other democracies.
