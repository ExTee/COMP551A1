I am used to people online attacking and insulting. Pretty hard to communicate when no context or tone of voice or expression is seen in person "}]}, "Body": "Bilingualism in Quebec City is lower than in the province overall, as Montreal drags the numbers up quite a bit, but it's still in the vicinity of 30%. However, people with public-facing jobs in central areas of the city are much, much more likely to be bilingual, with a pretty large majority being able to communicate in English. Oftentimes, even if you end up paired with one of those who can't, they can still fetch a colleague who's bilingual.\n\nThat said, I'd wager your odds of being able to strike a conversation in English with a random person on the streets is only around one third - a little below that, even. These odds are better downtown, and worse the further you get from downtown and main tourism hotspots. Finally, bilingualism is veeeery heavily tied to age, with the younger folk being overwhelmingly more likely to be bilingual.\n\nFor example, a young museum clerk downtown is near 100% guaranteed to be bilingual. However, a 60-year old mall patron in the suburbs is almost certainly not able to tell apart left from right in English. Though you can give trying to speak with randos a shot, I very strongly advise preparing a stock French phrase to open up with (ie \"Pardon, parlez-vous anglais\" - Excuse-me, do you speak English?), as accosting people in a \"foreign\" language is considered a reversal of the expected traveler's burden, and thus is seen as a rude display of entitlement.\n\nDo you know where your friend stayed/who he stayed with, and how he went about striking up conversation? This may have largely driven his experience.\n\nThe short of it is: you shouldn't have any trouble getting around major services in the core of the city even if you don't speak a word of French. However, as is to be expected, if you get \"adventurous\" and stray from the main centers, or you start hitting it up with the locals, you'll encounter the language barrier very frequently (most of the time, even).\n\n___\n\n>Were they just being dicks?\n\nNow, on a slightly off-topic note... you probably didn't mean to, but with that last line in your post, you set off a mine (those other aggressive responses probably tipped you off).\n\nThe idea that people \"refuse\" to speak English, or are in any way rude for not doing it, is considered *very, very insulting* in Quebec. I don't want to point the finger at you, I'm sure you mean well - but if you think about it, you can surely see why it's such a big irritant and basically a berserk button for many. Few other places on Earth would visitors go to expecting every local to be able to communicate with them, but Quebec is in a really awkward, damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation. We're constantly walking on eggshell with every tourist because each has a different expectation of what constitutes polite behaviour from us... and many come with preconceived notions, that, well, we're dicks.\n\nNext time you see travel to Quebec brought up in a large thread on Reddit, I invite you to read the comments. I can almost assure you you'll see *both* someone saying we're rude for \"refusing to speak English even though *I'm sure they could*\" (while providing no proof), and another that we're rude for \"gatekeeping French and immediately switching to English *because I wasn't good enough for them*\" (while providing no proof). Seriously, it's... almost clockwork. As you surely gathered, those complaints are mutually exclusive, hence the \"walking on eggshells\" idea.\n\nSo even those of us who ARE bilingual are constantly stuck between and a rock and a hard place. We're very often doomed to be the bad guys from the getgo because a lot of preconceived notions paint us as such, and anything we do *can potentially be construed as a confirmation of that preconceived notion*.\n\nSo, this is a sensitive issue, and a lot of people get mad when it's brought up. I understand where they're coming from, but I really lament the reaction of those who get pissy about it, especially considering that extremely ironically, these outbursts just feed the problem. People in general are just really, really bad at knowing when the proper response is just to de-escalate, this disaster of a thread being a prime example.\n\nEDIT: Lol laissez faire, OP est un sale cr\u00e9tin raciste avec un agenda.
