They have a strong \"family\" culture.\n\nNow for the culture, all the prejudices I've heard many things. I don't have any opinions because I've never been to India. Prejudices are prejudices, i know most aren't true:\n\nSociety. There's a big rape problem in India and women can't get much help because they could get raped even by the Police. Also, your parents can find a girlfriend for you and \"buy\" it in exchange of money or animals.\n\nMeat. It's impossible to eat beef and if you do you'll have problem not only with Police but also with your neighborhood.\n\nCrowd. It's impossible to find a quiet/lonesome spot in India, everything is crowded. And if you're a foreigner it's even more difficult because you'll be followed.\n\nCastes. There are people that are so revered that other people sweep the floor in front of them to make it clean, but there are also people that are from the lowest caste and they can't get anything. \n\nPolitics. India and Pakistan are ennemies. Many Indian men carry weapons on them on a daily basis.\n\nYou asked about the stereotypes \"against\" Indians but there are also good ones. India is heaven for people who like spicy food, and curry.  Bollywood movie are very well done and their love stories are liked by many women.\n\nREMINDER: This is just what I heard/read.
