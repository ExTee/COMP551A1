That's why the Trump odds were ridiculously low and very profitable. \n\nAlso, you have to keep in mind that the bookies have no stake in 'getting it right'. Bookies don't offer markets on political events to help people forecast the results. They do it purely to turn a profit. Whilst they lost a lot of money on Leave betters during Brexit, three quarters of the market voted remain. \n\nAs I said. Bookies just take cues from the establishment in arranging their odds on politics. Ignorantly thinking this is the voice of the people. Toward the end of the election, you will see Le Pen's odds increase.

We still have just under 4 years to see what he can accomplish, so the jury is still out. But I am staunchly against his neocon actions concerning Syria. I do hope that's the only mistake he will have made come 2020.
