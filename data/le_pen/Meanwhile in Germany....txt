I wasn't aware of it. You are wrong in claiming that *both* the girls have mental problems. Only the 14 year old had them, as she has undergone brain surgery that resulted in memory lapses. I haven't read the print version, but the fact that they were wildly wrong in their interpretation of the behaviour of these girls, and saw it as an invitation to get sexual with them is yet more proof of the severe problems with integrating people from cultures and countries with very different norms about sexuality. That the 14 year old Afghan was acquitted is fine, but as you mention, the 34 year old(!) did sexually harass the 18 year old, which is the main takeaway here.\n\nI've dug a little deeper into problems at Arriba, and this seems far from an isolated case. There's a lot of non-Western foreigners there and they evidently cause trouble and make the pool an uncomfortable place (especially for women and girls). For example, a group of Egyptians started a fight with the guards after one of them was ordered to put on proper swimwear (he was wearing jeans) or get out of the pool ([source](http://www.abendblatt.de/region/norderstedt/article207195017/Mit-Jeans-ins-Wasser-Wieder-Aerger-im-Arriba.html)). More tellingly, here's a selection from [the Google Places reviews](https://www.google.ru/maps/place/Arriba+Erlebnisbad/@53.68938,9.9990813,17z) for Arriba Erlebnisbad. It's worth noting that the date at which these started to be posted appears to coincide with an increase in ratings by reviewers with clearly non-Western names:\n\n>Sexuelle Bel\u00e4stigung durch Fl\u00fcchtlinge ist hier keine Seltenheit, meiner Freundin wurde unter den Bikini gefasst, von drei ausl\u00e4ndisch sprechenden \"Mitb\u00fcrgern\", ich vermute Afghanen. Die Bademeister k\u00fcmmern sich nicht, wir haben sofort das Bad verlassen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Wir waren vor kurzem zum Hamburger Hafenfest gewesen und hatten an einem Tag einen Ausflug dorthin unternommen. Das war und wird wohl der einzige gewesen sein. Das Bad wirkt zwar etwas zusammengeschustert ist aber sonst in Ordnung. Was aber nicht ging, ist dass meine Frau und meine Tochter st\u00e4ndig von Leuten mit \"Emigrationshintergrund\" angegafft wurden und sich wirklich zum 1. Mal in einem Spa\u00dfbad unwohl f\u00fchlten und sich stellenweise mit ein Handtuch zu deckten. Ansonsten rannten dort auch sehr viele Gro\u00dffamilien rum, welche durch den Staat finanziert werden - kurz gesagt - im Suff , im Bad - f\u00fcr deren Anstand und gegenseitige R\u00fccksichtnahme Fremdw\u00f6rter sind.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Sehr sch\u00f6nes Schwimmbad, bin dort h\u00e4ufig mit meinen Kindern inkl. der Geburtstage hingegangen. Leider haben die ein Problem mit jungen M\u00e4nnern, die minderj\u00e4hrige M\u00e4dchen, bel\u00e4stigen - dies gipfelte dann in Vergangenheit sogar in Vergewaltigungen. Die gemeldeten Taten die es in die Presse schaften erscheinen als der Gipfel des Eisberges. Leider bekommt die Leitung dies Problem nicht in den Griff und deshalb werden wir  das Bad nicht mehr besuchen. Notwendig w\u00e4re ein Bademeister der durchgreift und bei der ersten Beschwerde Ausverbote erteilt....\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Es war fr\u00fcher mal besser. Man hat zwar zus\u00e4tzliche Sicherheitsbeamte eingestellt, aber so eine richtige Wohlf\u00fchl-Atmosph\u00e4re kommt nicht wirklich auf. Absolut \u00e4rgerlich ist, dass man noch nicht mal seine Bahnen in Ruhe schwimmen kann, weil st\u00e4ndig Kinder oder Ausl\u00e4nder (die einen nicht verstehen oder verstehen wollen) einfach quer \u00fcber die Bahnen schwimmen. Da sorgen die Bademeister nicht gen\u00fcgend f\u00fcr Ordnung.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Nachdem einiges ge\u00e4ndert wurde, z.B. mehr Sicherheitspersonal,  f\u00fchlt man sich dort wohler. [...]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Das Schwimmbad selber ist klasse, leider v\u00f6llig unfreundliche Bademeister und ohne das es jetzt falsch Klingel kann, sollte man vielleicht eine andere Sprache lernen weil als deutscher is man hier klar in der Minderheit,und dies spiegelt sich leider in dem Benehmen wieder, werde jetzt hier nicht Gros auf rechtfertigen machen aber anstand und sowas wie H\u00f6flichkeit ist bei vielen Neub\u00fcrgern,wohl auf der Flucht verloren gegangen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>[...] Auch wir hatten negative Erfahrungen bei G\u00e4sten mit Migrationshintergrund, z.B. wenn es um simple Dinge wie das hinten Anstellen ging.

This is hysterical nonsense. And even supposing that they did not bring any problems, I still do not want to be replaced by people from cultures with which I have scarcely anything in common. I equally respect the rights of all other peoples to maintain cultural and ethnic hegemony in their countries and I assume you do as well (or do you think that for example Moroccans would be racists if they refused to take in hundreds of thousands of Europeans?). In case you agree, but think it's just a theoretical concern: it's not. For example, in major German cities, the native Germans are already a minority when you consider children under the age of six ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Identitarians/comments/56nr3l/the_majority_of_6_year_olds_in_germanys_major/))."}]}, "Body": "I'm just going to talk about the case of alleged sexual abuse at the pool, because I think it's clear that we have very different worldviews (and they are probably both pretty skewed).

The 34 year old did get sentenced to 8 month probation for \"mild sexual harrassment\" for kissing the 18 year old on the hip. This is a case of media manipulation exactly the other way aroud (which you're accusing me of falling for), there's a seriously complicated case but all that people know from the media is \"refugees harass underage girls in swimming pool\". \n\n> I prefer for them not to repeat the same mistake\n\nI prefer for people not to make the same mistake from 80 years ago, you know, the whole \"we hate entire cultures\" thing...\n"}]}, "Body": "No problem.\n\n>There's actually a lot of different types of toilets out there, so it kind of makes sense to put up instructions in some way.\n\nYes, they're used to squatting toilets, but the fact that they need explicit instructions to figure out how to use a Western toilet should tell you something about the difficulty of integrating them. If they've never been exposed to Western toilets in their life (i.e. through movies or just reading), then other aspects of Western culture will most likely be equally alien to them.\n\n>Wether it is necessary to tell people to not shit NEXT to the toilet is questionable, but I don't know if that's a common occurence.\n\nI think it's very likely that the organizations that build, run and facilitate these centres did not assume beforehand that this was going to happen. They probably only came up with this after a \"what the hell, these people are crapping on the floor\" moment. So yes, given the improbability of this being pre-planned, I'd say that they found out the hard way that it is necessary.\n\n>Regarding the \"squalor and filth\", this will happen everywhere when the housing situation gets out of control and facilities are overcrowded. Getting used to something like Germany's recycling policies would be quite hard for people that have lived the last years in a war zone, too.\n\nThis is the na\u00efve and frankly belittling attitude that people in subs like this dislike about you. Instead of holding them to the standards you hold your native countrymen to, you substantially lower your expectations and come up with all kinds of implausible excuses for their bad behaviour. Look at [this footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpJvDQVX_Dc) of Polish WWII refugees in Iran. They equally suffered the horrors of war and travelled thousands of kilometres to find refuge, but they take very proper care of themselves. My nation has hosted hundreds of thousands of Belgian refugees during the First World War and having read a thing or two about that, they too carried themselves with dignity even in large camps. Keeping things reasonably tidy and clean is not hard once you're not in a war zone any more. Spoiler: it's not unreasonable to assume that their bad behaviour is caused by [the fact that the vast majority of them come for the material benefits (money, housing)](https://twitter.com/HaraldDoornbos/status/773236433830248452) (source is a very well known and reputable Dutch war reporter who has actually been in the MENA region for a decade).\n\n>Public urination is actually not that rare in Germany, I don't know if refugees are known to just stop and piss wherever they are going, but especially around festivities there's TONS of Germans pissing everywhere.\n\nAgain, you're just making implausible excuses, perhaps to avoid conclusions that are incompatible with your current beliefs about refugees. You know just as well as I do that socially tolerated public urination is pretty much limited to festivals. These guides are obviously not trying to dissuade refugees from pissing at festivals, but from unacceptable public urination instead (you know, the kind of stuff that would pass in a country with poor hygienic infrastructure).\n\n>Hygienic instructions on toilets are common since forever (especially the \"wash your hands\" thing), and tips like throwing TP into the toilet, but not tampons or pads are actually helpful in my opinion. Don't forget that our WC system isn't the world standard, it makes sense to explain how it works.\n\nSee point 1. You have to be either dense or have very different standards of hygiene to think that throwing used toilet paper in the trash is a sensible option. In either case, it doesn't bode well in terms of integrating them.\n\n>It's a laminated piece of paper. Furthermore - you know who speaks Arabic and wants you to hate Arabs? Terrorists. I don't want to sound like someone who is trying to ignore reality, but stuff like this is reeeeaaallly questionable, because it will cause obvious emotions and there are a lot of groups that want to create these reactions, especially with such \"low effort\" content.\n\nWell I'm sorry, but this sounds like a blatant case of ignoring reality. Occam's Razor is very clear here: either someone put up a sign because they want Arab refugees to stop spitting, or a terrorist snuck into a refugee centre, put up a fake notification in the hopes that refugee sceptics would run across it, take a picture, upload it on the internet and whip up anti-Muslim sentiment. I'm actually baffled as to how you can think the latter is even plausible.\n\n>I think I know the story, and by now it's clear that the two girls that were \"harassed\" have mental problems and one of them has accused several men of sexual abuse (in always almost exactly the same way). This is a really sad case of misinformation, but the damage is already done.\n\nSource please. Also, even if that's the case, it doesn't disprove that there's an issue here, because there have been many incidents like it elsewhere.\n\n>Isn't this exactly the way people say we have to handle immigrants? Explicitly tell them the rules they have to follow? Also, these rules are all kind of obvious/stupid, \"don't push people/don't drown people\" - thanks for the tip man.\n\nWho's saying that? But let's suppose that that's the case.. doesn't that just prove how insane and irresponsible this whole project is? You're taking in many hundreds of thousands of people that have to be trained not to behave like savages. Do you really think that you have the resources to pull that off? And if you someone reduce the problematic behaviour to an acceptable level, what is your long term plan for hundreds of thousands of poorly educated manual labourers who don't speak your language and are culturally very distant from you (so will have a harder time bonding with you)?\n\n>Where's this guy from? AFAIK most refugees are from Syria, and this guy doesn't look like he's from anywhere near that...\n\nIt's a bit out of scope, yes, but note that I was talking about non-Western immigrants and refugees. I'm therefore including dark-skinned Africans, because they make up a sizeable part of the refugee inflow. In fact, in the summer of 2015 Syrians only accounted for about 20% of the inflow ([Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240010/Number-refugees-arriving-Europe-soars-85-year-just-one-five-war-torn-Syria.html), and don't complain about that because I've checked the stats from Eurostat myself back when this news came out and it's accurate). [While the percentage of Syrians has gone up since then](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_quarterly_report), a large number of \"refugees\" are still from non-MENA countries that aren't even unsafe. That is, they are in it for the money and they should be told to fuck off and try it again the legal way instead of setting up camps in France.\n\n>You are right, there are definitely problems with refugees all over Europe, but I don't think that individual cases, misinformation and twitter pictures are a good way to determine the situation.\n\nSorry to be blunt, but they're individual cases to you because you've probably been sucking on the tit of established left-leaning media that have a vested interest in keeping up the narrative, either because its collapse would invalidate their ideology, or more cynically, because importing hundreds of thousands of poorly educated young men provides a cheap source of labour for them to exploit. I don't think any of my claims are misinformed (if you disagree after reading the above, let me know), and \"Twitter pictures\" is a useless accusation because it's the content and reliability of those pictures that counts, not the medium by which they are distributed.\n\n>It's really easy to have your world view skewed when you read about these things every day - imagine every car crash in Germany would make national news, you'd likely never drive again without fear for your life.\n\nYou do know that media attention to car crashes is what forced the car industry to start implementing some safety measures? Anyway, the Left has already ignored it once by giving permanent residence to \"temporary\" guest workers, which is how we ended up with a whole host of crap (many hundreds of Europeans killed because of Islamic terrorism, self-imposed restrictions on free speech out of fear, increased surveillance, loss of social cohesion, and now local and national Islamic political parties in my own country) with scarcely anything of value in return. I prefer for them not to repeat the same mistake in their high-minded idealism.\n\nIf you want to chat, PM me and I'll give you contact details."}]}, "Body": "Thank you for your thorough reply, I really appreciate it.

This is a really sad case of misinformation, but the damage is already done.\n\n7. Isn't this exactly the way people say we have to handle immigrants? Explicitly tell them the rules they have to follow? Also, these rules are all kind of obvious/stupid, \"don't push people/don't drown people\" - thanks for the tip man. \n\n8. Where's this guy from? AFAIK most refugees are from Syria, and this guy doesn't look like he's from anywhere near that...\n\nYou are right, there are definitely problems with refugees all over Europe, but I don't think that individual cases, misinformation and twitter pictures are a good way to determine the situation. It's really easy to have your world view skewed when you read about these things every day - imagine every car crash in Germany would make national news, you'd likely never drive again without fear for your life. \n\nThanks again for taking your time to discuss with me and other people that most likely stumbled here via /r/all!"}]}, "Body": "This could well be a fake, yes. This is the earliest source I was able to find: https://twitter.com/eelko76/status/659809677581156352 That guy is still active on Twitter so if you want to get to the bottom of this, just ask him where he got the picture.\n\nNevertheless, there have been plenty of reports of.. uh, lack of Euro-style potty training among immigrants (among other hygienic issues). Here are some examples:\n\n1. In The Netherlands, some (temporary) refugee centres have been reported to be straight up defiled by behaviour like this (sorry, too busy to find the source, but it was reported in reputable newspapers). \n\n2. [Here](http://erstaunlich.at/images/bildershow/spielf/1.JPG)'s an example of actual instructions aimed put up at the toilets in an Austrian refugee centre, including the instruction *not* to shit besides the toilet. The source is Die Monatliche, which is a reputable Austrian monthly. Unfortunately I can't find their article, but [this article](http://erstaunlich.at/index.php?view=article&id=4100:militaer-verweigert-presse-den-zugang-zu-fluechtlingen) should be sufficient to establish the credibility of this story. Also note that just like the Dutch refugee centres, the report explicitly mentions the squalor and filth that the refugees have caused there. See the other pictures from that article.\n\n3. Die Linke (German (far)-left party) made a guide for refugees called \"Germans be like\" (source: [focus.de](http://www.focus.de/politik/videos/knigge-fuer-asylbewerber-germans-be-like-die-linke-verteilt-benimmheftchen-fuer-fluechtlinge_id_5076770.html)). It includes instructions *not* to urinate in public.\n\n4. Another guide for refugees (http://refugeeguide.de/en/) also has some instructions on defecating that really make you question whether it's a good idea to let these people in by the hundreds of thousands: \"Urinating in public can be an offense. Public toilets (WCs) are available in most places. WCs usually have toilet paper, but not a bidet. It is perfectly OK to throw toilet paper into the toilet. Don\u2019t throw it into the waste bin. However, you should throw sanitary pads or tampons into the bin not into the toilet. There\u2019s usually a toilet brush next to the toilet: use the brush to clean off any marks you\u2019ve made. Make sure you leave the toilet clean and dry. Therefore, it is advisable to use the toilet in a sitting position. Where no urinal is available, this applies for men, too. For reasons of hygiene it is expected that you wash your hands before you leave the toilet.\"\n\n5. [Here](https://twitter.com/Bedburg_Puetz/status/664761693139005440)'s a public sign with Arabic instructions not to spit on the floor. Unfortunately I haven't found the source yet, but it's clearly not a photoshop and given that the Arabic is accurate it is most likely legit.\n\n6. [Here](http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/deutschland/hamburg-debatte-um-sexuelle-gewalt-in-baedern-flammt-erneut-auf-aid-1.5813211)'s a sign with instructions not to sexually harass girls at the Aribba pool in Norderstedt. They had to put it up after a 34 year old refugee harassed ~~a 14~~ an 18 year old German girl. This stuff happens too frequently to be written off as incidents. For example, the pool in Bornheim bei Bonn had to ban all male refugees because of repeated problems (mentioned in this article). Pools in The Netherlands have these problems as well.\n\n7. [Here](https://twitter.com/valaki_berlin/status/717729324523241472)'s instructions in Arabic at a Berlin pool, including instructions on not harassing girls and instructions on following the orders of the lifeguards *regardless of whether they're male or female*.\n\n7. [Here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3a2_1452443227)'s a guy taking a shit and a piss in the metro at Alexanderplatz, Berlin, Germany.\n\nI could easily spend hours compiling many more examples of this stuff, but I hope that it suffices to say there are severe structural problems with non-Western immigrants and refugees in terms of hygiene and appropriate behaviour.\n\n/u/yondaime008, /u/SushiGato, /u/AngelDarkened"}], "SushiGato": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "You are not allowed to speak out like that.
