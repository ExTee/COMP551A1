I never went to La Camargue, but you should check it out. Arles (which is close to La Camargue) is a nice (small) city but never went there neither. https://travelguide.michelin.com/europe/france/provence-french-riviera/bouches-du-rhone/arles\n\n- After that head out to Marseille if you want to enjoy the beach. It's a big city. Check out \"calanques Marseille\" in Google. It's very nice but if you are not looking for a \"beach city\" you can skip it. Otherwise https://travelguide.michelin.com/europe/france/provence-french-riviera/bouches-du-rhone/marseille\n\n- Then go to Aix-en-Provence, great city, a lot of students and expats. Plenty of people will speak Engilsh. Spend at least 1 day there.\n\n- From Aix or Marseille or even Arles, you should check Les Baux de Provence, very nice, old village but full of tourists, if you can go there during the week, https://travelguide.michelin.com/europe/france/provence-french-riviera/bouches-du-rhone/les-baux-de-provence. There check out Les Carri\u00e8res and the Castle (very very very breathtaking viewpoint at the top)\n\n- For wines in the center/north, go to Beaune. Nice city, a bit like Aix-en-Provence, small, multilingual a bit bourgeois.\n\n\nFor the rest check out Google cause I never went there ;)"}], "antonbardem": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Hope this wasn't you: http://www.bfmtv.com/police-justice/marseille-deux-touristes-americaines-aspergees-a-l-acide-a-la-garde-saint-charles-1258175.html\n\nYou are going to some pretty sketchy cities.

It can help for your trip.\n\nPlease note that you have to pay Toll in France and it is very expensive. DO NOT refuel on the highway, its 20 cent more expensive than in small cities.\nYou can have an idea of time and money needed with this website for your journey (it takes in count the toll)\n https://www.viamichelin.fr/\nDo not let anything visible like a GPS or a backpack on the seats.\n\nIt might be less expensive to fly from Paris to Bordeaux and then to rent a car from there. Same thing from Marseilles to Paris for example. You will waste a lot of time and money on the road.\n\nIt might be wise to stay in a particular area like Linmark said. For exemple not so far from Marseilles, you can go to Gorges du Verdon. In the same region, you can try that : http://www.moveyouralps.com/fr/routes-de-la-lavande/itineraire-lavande\n\nIf you want to eat in good restaurants, you can buy a book \"le guide du routard\" or just go to their website. Trip Advisor obviously is also good. http://www.routard.com/\n\nI don't know if you speak french; but you can use google translate to translate a full website.\n\nHave fun in France :)\n\nEDIT: I have just noticed there is probably no Lavender anymore at this time of the year."}]}, "selftext": "Hey all!
