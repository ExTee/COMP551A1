The show is animated with Adobe Flash software; all the production is done in France except the special episodes \"Noximilien l'Horloger\" and \"Ogrest, la L\u00e9gende\", both produced in Japan.

You may have to take a broader approach. Here is a list of [french series](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchSeries). Unfortunally, most of it is trash.\n\n* If you like video games, you could watch *[Joueur du Grenier](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_yP2DpIgs5Y1uWC0T03Chw)* on YouTube, testing rotten old games. Some of the episodes have been subbed.\n\n* Still game-themed you have the web serie *[NOOB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXab7PegMCM&list=PLcSjKfSVEgz_hEKlUOrww1RjVo5g9X67r)* (also on YouTube, also subbed).\n\n* If you don't like video games, watch *[Kaamelott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxhcLwVCgz0&list=PLI29ujhdHQUnUpiFB86Re7CV-UWopDlFc)*. It's blocked here in France so I can't tell if there is subtitles but my bet is yes.\n\n* We also have a shonen-like french anime: *[Wakfu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWn0_vrdvXc&list=PLLwcL6leJJn5d4lPQD-cFjif_oGwFXHAj)*. It's really nothing like *Family Guy* but it's entertaining (if you like the anime style of course). Unfortunaly it's *not* subbed on YouTube but I bet you know what to do, don't you? PM me if you don't.\n\n* If none of this interest you, try *Les Guignols de l'Info*. It was a great show until recently when they killed it and replaced it with bland crap but you should be able to find some old compilation here and there.\n\nYou can always watch *South Park* and the *Simpsons* in french dubbing: it is notoriously good. I don't know about *Family Guy* dubbing tho.\n\nEdit: sorted list [here](https://www.senscritique.com/liste/Serie_d_animation_francaise/883000#page-1/order-note/)."}], "gromfe": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "I don't think there's really something like those cartoons, but you can there's many other nice cartoons like Wakfu, les zinzins de l'espace, wombat city, les lascars, orson et olivia, la famille pirate, les mondes engloutis, all the tintins, blacke et mortimer, titeuf, les myst\u00e9rieuses cit\u00e9s d'or etc..."}], "SansFiltre": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Les shadocks?"}], "friendlydeadbeat": [{"Replies": {"gr0gui": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "Oh c \u00e9tait sympa ca avec la BO de dj abdel.\n"}]}, "Body": "Funky Cops."}], "ptony": [{"Replies": {}, "Body": "South Park use simple vocabulary and sentences.
