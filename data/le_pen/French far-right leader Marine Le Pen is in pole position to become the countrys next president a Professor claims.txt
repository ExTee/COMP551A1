The US is estimated to need $3bil to rebuild its infrastructure and Trump also said he wants to use American steel and materials to rebuild the country.\n\nI would also say that savings/investment is more dependent on interest rates rather than tax cuts. Higher rates = put your money in banks for guaranteed safer returns, Lower rates = put your money in the market for risky higher returns. Anybody who had their money in banks when the Fed cut its interest rates to near zero was making a poor investment decision. You wouldn't have made any money to keep up with inflation and the stock market boomed within that time.\n"}]}, "Body": "The main reason why stock indexes have risen since Trump's win, which the market was not expecting, is the expectation that, with Trump in the WH and republican majorities in both legislative offices, the stage is set for tax cuts for the wealthy.   Giving more money to the 1% tends to increase savings/investment, so naturally a lot of that flows into the stock market.  This has much less to do with hopes about the economy than a simple relationship between a more regressive tax policy and increased demand for investment vehicles, e.g. stocks."}]}, "Body": "Have you seen the Dow Jones and S&P 500?
