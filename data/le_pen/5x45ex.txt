If you realllllllly want to commit to that you'll have to overlook all of those documents and mandates that specify exactly this. I mean, it's foundational to the EU. It's history. Maybe in practice that's not what people care about on a day to day basis, but that's why it was set up. \n\nYou're also saying it's demonstrably false that the number of deaths inside Europe due to terrorism amounts to anything more than an impossibly tiny fraction of total deaths in Europe? How many millions of Europeans died (cancer, accidents, regular murder) over the past few years, and how many hundred due to terrorism? \n\nRealising that terrorism is less dangerous than lighting for you should tell you something important. **Your fear is imaginary. It's like being afraid that the sky will fall, when sickness or accident or regular foul play are millions of times more likely to kill you.** Furthermore, on the topic of immigration, it's demonstrably **true** that migrants of all kinds commit less crimes statistically per capita than the the 'donor' country in which they now live. Which is to say, the cheery-picking of migrant crime has led to an imaginary fear of immigrants. \n\nI mean seriously, think of all of the millions of migrants that have come in.

Please go on to the point where your 'data' showing all the terrible harms done by migrants is anything more than cherry-picking of the data on the same level of 'neutrality' as breitbart. Go on to the point where the tiny minority of migrants that do come in and commit crimes is seen as more serious  a problem than leaving hundreds of thousands of people to be slaughtered by ISIS. \n\nI'm a little confused here. Are you saying that the suffering of having to put up with refugees is so big a burden to bare that we should condemn hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths? Because there are not statistics in existence that says the current wave of immigration has led to a major increase in crime in Europe (beyond the simple, proportional bump you get in crime when you suddenly add a few million to a population). \n\nI mean, would you be convinced by me saying \"there are lots of muslims in London, and mostly they behave themselves\" and \"there are lots of muslims in Madrid, and mostly they behave themselves\" as an argument for bringing more immigrants to Europe? That's exactly as effective an argument as saying 'they have had some problems in Malmo and in Brussels'. And the funnier thing is, if you really want to play the numbers game, there are far, far, far more well-behaving migrants coming in that there are criminal ones.\n\nIt's funny that every time I have this discussion, the argument breaks down into either \"look at what happened in X\" (Cologne was the standard for years) or \"your data is fake because it was paid for by pro-Europe shills\". \n\nLet's take politically neutral raw German police data on migrant crime that found that migrant involvement in crimes was \"clearly disproportionately low\" compared to the rest of the German population:\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-crime-idUSKCN0YT28V\n\nOr any of the studies that specifically refute the migrant crime narrative: http://www.dw.com/en/study-contradicts-efforts-to-link-migrants-to-crime/a-19390414\n\n\"no increase in the number offenses per 100,000 people for the most common types of crimes. However, he said there had been two areas that had indeed shown significant increases: burglaries and pickpocketing.\"\n\nSo you're saying an increase in robbery and burglaries (i.e. petty crime) is worth handing ISIS a massive win (i.e. they achieve their goals of killing off heretic Muslims, shore up their control of the muslim faith in their areas, and prevent any positive spin of Europe presenting itself as a friend to Islam by protecting those most vulnerable to ISIS - other muslims). You're saying that because about one in X tens of thousands of those migrants might try and rob my iphone on the bus, we should throw all of those families to ISIS for prompt murder and grant ISIS its greatest victory?\n\nThis is the point where get to, where for all the attempts I make to see your argument as charitably as I can, there just seems like there's no way to make the data work on your behalf without already having an extremely prejudiced view of these migrants. When you're literally talking about throwing thousands and thousands of children back into the jaws of ISIS, you've got to have some damn convincing data, not old rhetoric and fear bolstered by modern showmanship."}]}, "Body": "It's *never* dark and fascist to reinforce the borders of a welfare state, to prevent people from coming in.\n\nThe rest of your story seems to be based in globalist dogma and not in the facts as they occur in the EU member states.

It's just echo-chamber filler. Furthermore, Greece is not acttually considered a threat to the EU, and is at worst seen more as a failing of the EU.\n\n>If the EU keeps destabilizing its member states with forced mass immigration from Africa and the Middle East, what do you think will happen?\n\nForced mass immigration? I think you're kind of underestimating the problem of having a continuous land mass to the middle east and only a spit of water from Africa. The US has 2 land borders (one of which is Canada) and in 2017 immigration was STILL a key election issue. Imagine the immigration mess in the US if people in the middle east and Africa could suddenly and easily walk or get a cheap, few hour boat trip and get to the states. It'd be chaos, and simply closing the borders would not be an easy solution.\n\nImagine how dark and fascist you'd have to go to genuinely reinforce Europe's borders under these circumstances. Imagine the expense, the unbelievable PR win it would be for ISIS. ISIS wants all those Muslims back in the East so they can kill or convert them to their cause. Either option is bad for the West, much much more so than a tiny increase in the overall muslim population of Europe and the micro-chance of being a victim of terorisim from the perspective of EU citizens. ***The destabilisation you talk of is coming from the misplaced fear of migrants, not the migrants themselves***.\n\nI hope you're aware that the overwhelming majority of victims of islamic extremism are actually muslims themselves? The whole 'they're all economic migrants' thing isn't funny, it's absolutely unfounded and clearly a position generated by islamophobic racists. There is no data backing this up whatsoever. \n\nMore generally, people online seem not to understand that NOT having an open immigration policy also would come with tremendous problems, far more (in the minds of Europe's top analysts apparently, and indeed IMO) than the negatives of immigration. \n\n>If we don't intervene the EU will cause the very thing it was meant to prevent.\n\nThis is pretty ironic. You're apparently saying that the fear of immigration is so serious that it could start a war.... even though it can be clearly demonstrated that the fears over immigrants are totally misplaced (again, almost no increase in terrorism, no actual increase in crime relative to regular EU citizens, tens of millions of muslims living in Europe for generations already - i.e. Europe has a long culture of Islamic minorities). \n\nI find this kind of ironic, but also terrifying, because this kind of short-sightedness is shared by millions now.... people want to start a war that could kill potentially hundreds of thousands of people because a few dozen people were killed over the course of 4-5 years. MAYBE, just MAYBE, it's better to see terrorism as blowback to Western interventionism, and not frame it simply as evil muslims doing their thing and therefore don't let any muslims in. That kind of sounds like the policy a child would make.\n\nAlso, I'd also like to add that I think it's tremendously cowardly to fear the TINY risk of increased terrorism activity so badly that you'd literally throw hundreds of thousands of muslims fleeing ISIS back to the wolves, to be drowned in cages and burned alive.
